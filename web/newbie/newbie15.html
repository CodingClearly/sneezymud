<P>
The new spell system in place for SneezyMUD 4.1 is one that 
hopefully you'll find more realistic.  (If you're having
trouble thinking of "magic" as "realistic" then you haven't
been mudding enough.)
<P>
Overview
<HR WIDTH=40% ALIGN=LEFT>
Casting a spell requires none, one, or any combination of multiple 
components, each component of type verbal, gestural, or material.  Cleric 
spells are granted success by their deities and will never require either a 
material component or a gestural component, but a cleric must always 
have a holy symbol to pray for any cleric spell.  That holy symbol must 
either be held or worn at the time.  (See HELP <A HREF="../help/holy_symbol">HOLY SYMBOL</A> and HELP 
<A HREF="../help/devotion">DEVOTION</A>.)
<P>
Also, each spell has a difficulty level (a value that dictates
the chance a cleric or mage has at successfully completing that spell) and a
mana or piety level (the amount of mana or piety drained from the 
magic-user to invoke the spell).  Based upon the difficulty level of a 
spell, the competence of the magic-user (based on his intelligence and 
wisdom), and a random factor, the will result usually in a normal 
success, but can result in either critical success or critical failure.  
A critical success would result in extra damage done to the victim on an 
offensive spell (for example), while a critical failure could result in 
damage to the spell-caster and embarrassment at his lack of ability to 
perform the function of his life-training in front of others :)
<P>
Components - General
<HR WIDTH=40% ALIGN=LEFT>
Each spell requires none, one, or any combination of multiple 
components.  These components will each be of type verbal, 
gestural, or material.  A spell not properly prepared for by 
ignoring some or all the components is a wasted spell, and the 
caster is still required to pay the mana price -- the idea is 
that the caster went through the mind-numbing experience of 
attempting to draw upon pent up inherent energies from the ether 
and channel them into a useful force to do his bidding, except he 
screwed up and forgot a component.  The lesson is to be careful 
when preparing to mess with these forces and make sure the caster 
is properly prepared for spell-casting before he starts.  A mage
can change his level of ability in the "wizardry" skill (see also
HELP <A HREF="../help/wizardry">WIZARDRY</A>) and not be required to perform as many gestural
and verbal components of a spell, restricting him less in tight
situations where his hands may be needed for something other than
arm-waving -- perhaps to wield a weapon or hold a torch.  The
player can determine the components required for each spell by
getting help on that spell (e.g., help fly).
<P>
Components - Verbal
<HR WIDTH=40% ALIGN=LEFT>
A verbal component is the spoken element of the spell-casting 
process.  It requires that the caster be able to speak, i.e., not 
magically silenced or in a silent room.  The mage can learn to cast
spells without any verbal incantation (see HELP <A HREF="../help/wizardry">WIZARDRY</A>).
<P>
Components - Gestural
<HR WIDTH=40% ALIGN=LEFT>
A gestural component is the "arm waving" element of the spell
process.  It requires that the caster has usable arms and 
hands and is not holding anything in those hands.  There are four 
exceptions to this rule.  1) Clerics may hold a holy symbol in a 
hand while praying with a gestural component.  2) Material
components for a spell are required to be held in either the caster's
hand or in a component bag, which the caster must also hold in his
hand.  3) The mage's level of ability in the "wizardry" skill can
affect all of the above (see HELP <A HREF="../help/wizardry">WIZARDRY</A>).  4) A cleric's level of 
ability in the "devotion" skill can affect the requirement of where he 
must hold or wear the holy symbol.
<P>
The player may assume that all verbal and gestural components are 
learned at the time of the character's training for them when he 
gains a level.  The human behind the keyboard is not required to 
type in a string of magical characters after a "say" command.
<P>
Components - Material
<HR WIDTH=40% ALIGN=LEFT>
A material component is a sacrificial item that is destroyed when 
the spell is cast.  A material component must be held by the 
caster in his hand at casting time but can alternatively be 
stored inside a component bag, which must be held by the caster.  
The individual material components required for various spells 
are all available around Grimhaven and its surrounding 
adventuring areas.  The mage can learn to use components
that are inside a component bag on his belt (see HELP <A HREF="../help/wizardry">WIZARDRY</A>).
<P>
Holy Symbols - General
<HR WIDTH=40% ALIGN=LEFT>
While a cleric will never be required to supply a material 
component or perform a physical gesture to pray for a spell, a cleric
will always be required to have a holy symbol to cast any clerical
spell.  A holy symbol is the device through which a cleric's deity
delivers a portion of his power to the cleric to enable him to cast
a spell.  Holy symbols must be either held in a hand, worn or in 
inventory.  (See HELP <A HREF="../help/devotion">DEVOTION</A> and HELP <A HREF="../help/holy_symbol">HOLY SYMBOL</A>)
<P>
Holy Symbols - Strength
<HR WIDTH=40% ALIGN=LEFT>
Each holy symbol has a strength level.  Each time a spell is channeled 
through a holy symbol, its structure is weakened.  Eventually, 
after enough use, the use of a holy symbol during prayer 
will cause the holy symbol to shatter.  This will not hurt the 
spell prayed for at the time, but the player will have to find 
another holy symbol before he can pray for another spell.  There are 
holy symbols of various strength levels scattered throughout 
Grimhaven and its surrounding adventuring areas for either 
purchase or discovery.  A good indication of a holy symbol's 
initial strength is the type of material it is made of.
<P>
Difficulty Level
<HR WIDTH=40% ALIGN=LEFT>
The difficulty level of a spell is a value that depicts how easy 
or how difficult it is to successfully use a spell with a high level of 
efficiency to produce the desired results.  The range of values 
is TRIVIAL, EASY, NORMAL, DIFFICULT, and DANGEROUS.  These values 
dictate the magic-user's chances of successfully creating the 
spell, creating the spell perfectly (gaining bonuses), or 
accidentally screwing up, which could lead to unwanted results, 
like possible death or dismemberment :)
<P>
Mana, Piety, Meditation and Penance
<HR WIDTH=40% ALIGN=LEFT>
Mages, also known as mana users, use their mana points to cast their 
spells. Certain spells will cost more mana points than others, and most 
spells decrease in cost upon reaching higher levels. The fastest way for 
a mana user to regain lost spell points is through focused meditation.  
This requires absolute silence in the room around the mana user.
<P>
Clerics use the power channeled to them from their deity, known as piety, 
to invoke their prayers.  Each prayer will cost the cleric a certain amount 
of piety, and like mana, most prayers decrease in cost upon reaching higher 
levels. The fastest way for a cleric to regain lost piety is through 
focused penance.  This requires absolute silence in the room around the 
cleric.
