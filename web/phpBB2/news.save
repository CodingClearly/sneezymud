==========================================================================
04-23-06 : A new cgi utility has been added at:
	   http://sneezy.saw.net/shopinfo.cgi
           This replaces the old shoplog.cgi utility.

04-22-06 : The cashier in the casino now sells card decks and individual
           cards.  You can put the cards in the deck and shuffle them, to
           play your own card games.  Or just carry around a pack of aces
           and drop one whenever you kill someone.  Whatever.

04-22-06 : The win limit of the Hi-Lo game in the casino has been increased
           by one game, giving you a better chance to win money.

04-16-06 : The 'score' command now shows your total skill points, and your
           average per skill.

04-16-06 : The 'levels' command now shows experience required for levels up
           to 100.  Of course, you can't level past 50, but you can now check
           when you will be getting post-50 practices.

04-03-06 : You may find now that especially hard hits in combat will cause
           bruises.  Be the first kid on your block with a big purple shiner!

04-03-06 : Remember that overpowered monk skill called bonebreak?
           It's back.

04-02-06 : The toggle command now shows the status of the double exp toggle,
           so now you can stop asking me if it's on or not.

03-25-06 : Disarm learning boosted a little.

03-21-06 : Upped the brick loads.

03-14-06 : The 'death mist' spell will no longer affect creatures immune
           to disease.  Also, the caster has a chance dependent on his or
           her skill with the spell to avoid the mist's effects.  This
           will also apply to group members.

03-12-06 : Teeth are now weightless and teeth necklaces are now wearable.

03-04-06 : Shouts in color can be seen by others now.  The color shouts
           setting also works properly now.

           frequently.

02-27-06 : The property clerk now sells keys.

02-06-06 : New monk skill: defenestrate.

01-25-06 : New warrior skill: taunt.

01-25-06 : New warrior skill: riposte.

01-24-06 : The trophy board now highlights your name if you are in the
	   displayed results.  If you are not in the top 25, then your name
           and stats are shown as the last, unranked, entry.

01-24-06 : Re-calculated the trophyplayer summary table, which has resulted
           in some slight shifts on the trophy board in the morgue.  I believe
           this table got a little bit out of sync due to recent database
           restores and crashes.

01-15-05 : Fixed a bug that allowed scrolls to be recited in non-magic rooms.

01-06-06 : Sidartha got his file.

01-01-06 : The Clarity and Celerite rituals have been modified. Please be
           sure to update your knowledge of those rituals by checking the
           helpfiles.

12-31-05 : Six month brick quest started. Details on the forums.

12-21-05 : Increased the load rate percentage.  This is part one of several
           changes related to item loads.

10-09-05 : Mystery potions are now normal liquids like other potions, so you
           can sip them, pour them into other containers, etc.

10-01-05 : Added a "time" option to prompt.  I've also moved prompt 
           information to database storage, so your prompts have been reset.
           Sorry.

08-26-05 : Characters with the mute trait can now communicate with gods using
           ask, tell, and whisper.  Ask and whisper still require that they be
           in the same room.

08-24-05 : There have been some anomalies in the awarding of practices over the
           past several years.  These will be corrected upon login for those
           players affected if possible.  Alternatively, if there is a small
           discrepancy, your character may not gain practices for a little
           while until the discrepancy is resolved.  If there is a large
           discrepancy that requires immortal intervention you will know about
           it.  For those players gaining practices - enjoy!

08-22-05 : Added a couple of sprites to reward the most accomplished perma
           death online, and the most accomplished unique trophy killer
           online.

08-16-05 : Pipeweed is not the only smokable drug anymore, Enjoy :)

08-12-05 : Empty potion containers that are dropped will now shatter.

08-10-05 : Added lumberjack skill to the adventuring discipline (help

           they did previously.

08-10-05 : "att personal" now shows your character traits.

08-09-05 : Increased butcher output to a more reasonable amount.

08-09-05 : Added a new character creation available to people with level 50
           characters.  (help Fae Touched)  Also redid the menus for creation.
           Bug Maror if there is any problem.

08-09-05 : Potions of characteristics will now always bump a characteristic.
           No more youth from them.

08-09-05 : Fixed a bug with sanctuary prayers.  There is a slightly higher
           chance for a critical sanctuary now.

08-09-05 : Fixed a few intances where dexterity was inappropriately used to
           measure defensive capability, and replaced it with agility.

08-02-05 : Due to the recent interest in permadeaths, the market square
           monument now shows more information.

06-30-05 : Added some environmental code dealing with fire and floods.
           Fires are rather dangerous now; be careful.

05-27-05 : Psionics has been added as a choosable character trait.

04-22-05 : GCC 4.0.0 was causing crashes, so we're back to the old compiler.

04-22-05 : A deny corpse loot flag has been added to toggle.  When this flag
           is on, only you may loot your corpse.  When it is off, anyone
           may loot your corpse.

04-22-05 : We are now running GCC 4.0.0, in case anyone cares.

04-21-05 : Vermin attraction to trash piles has been disabled.

04-20-05 : Blind players with true sight can now cast eyes of fertuman.
           Mute players can't emote anymore.  Better practice up on sign.

04-19-05 : Equipment load rates will slowly lowered over the next
           three months.

04-19-05 : Mute players can now interact with mobs using sign.

04-16-05 : Shops now have a maximum inventory of 2500 items.  Shops that
           meet or exceed this limit will not be able to buy more items.

04-06-05 : The Grimhaven City Council has issued a hospice tax in Grimhaven.

03-29-05 : Items inside of trash piles will now slowly decay.

03-27-05 : Selecting no traits should no longer cause -1 starting stat points.

03-24-05 : All small spellbags, grenulpa bags, and herbal pouches that are 
           empty will now poof when dropped. Hope this helps with trash.

03-21-05 : Changed the crit hit modifier to be a curve rather than linear.
           Mobs at much higher levels will be unlikely to suffer crit hits.

03-21-05 : Added necrophobia, alcoholism and tourettes character traits.
	   Changed point value for mute trait.

03-19-05 : Some internal changes were done to how titles are saved.  I tried
           to convert everyones titles to the new format, but if you lost
           your title, I apologize.

03-18-05 : Players with truesight or clarity can now recite scrolls while
           blind.

03-12-05 : Enabled character traits.  You can select traits during character
           creation.  Check it out!

03-10-05 : Mobiles with sufficient skill will now utilize the slit skill
           just like they can use backstab. Yay for equality!

03-04-05 : Mobiles will now slowly forget people they are angry with.

03-04-05 : Protection from fire scrolls should work as expected now.

02-15-05 : Made a first attempt at fixing the bug that generates an error
           message when trying to look at a room.

01-22-04 : Merged in changes that were lost in the crash.  Primarily, this
           means a few warrior disciplines have been renamed and skills
           shuffled slightly.

11-29-04 : Trash piles are now in.

11-23-04 : A property clerk has setup an office in the GH bank.  Information
           about owned homes is now publically available through the clerk.
           If you own a home and are not listed, please let someone know so
           you can be added to the list.  If you don't, you may be subject
           to repossession in the future.

11-23-04 : Fishing spots will now respawn naturally.  This is a slow process
           so don't expect to be able to fish at the same spots forever.

11-14-04 : On leveling you will now get a message if there are any new quests
           available to you.

11-07-04 : Hurl now adds lag, even if the attempt didn't succeed.

11-04-04 : Minor adjustment to the below change to allow dropping in the
           dump.

11-03-04 : You can no longer drop trash in shops, this should help with the
           clutter.

10-21-04 : You can now use 'value all.damaged' in a repair shop to get a listing
           of items and costs plus a total cost at the end.  This only works with
           items in your inventory and nothing currently worn or in containers.

10-12-04 : Changed command parsing a little.  Say "me" now says "me" and not
           your name.  You can recite scrolls on "me" or "self" or "tank" now.
           Although the "tank" target only works if the tank is in your group
           and fighting.  Report bugs with command parsing to Angus.

           Monks will now see the effect of learning weapon specializations,
           just like all the other classes.

09-22-04 : The "fished out" status of rooms is no longer revealed.

09-20-04 : Liquids will now dilute in fountains and the like.

09-11-04 : Mobiles carrying corpses will now be placed on top of the room
           list when killed, instead of below the said corpses.

09-08-04 : Prayers including, but not limited to, blind, curse, wither limb,
           numb, and paralyze will now cause the victim to hate, even if the
           prayer doesn't succeed.  Reciting faerie fire scrolls and icy grip
           scrolls will now cause the victim to hate the caster.  The ranger
           repair skill has been removed from rangers.  Monks now can also
           repair organic and wood materials.  A crash bug with mob hating is
           now fixed.

09-07-04 : Cure disease, and wohlin, now have a slim chance of removing
           leprosy from limbs.

09-02-04 : Lifeforce is now capped at 32000.  This should prevent the loop
           issue.  Report any strange reactions to your nearest coder if
           any unforeseen side effects spawn from this.

09-01-04 : No-heal rooms are now described separately from peaceful rooms.

08-31-04 : Added 3 new lines of information to the zone command, when used
           with an argument.

08-31-04 : Corrected an issue with the zones command that was preventing some
           zones to be viewable when used with an argument.  Also added an
           index value to each entry, shown to the left, that can be used to
           look at said zone without having to type the zonename.

08-29-04 : Taloc now sells teeth necklaces.  You can put teeth on'em.  They
           don't really do anything yet, but they will.

08-29-04 : Increased the chance of shove success.  Give it a try and let
           me know how it is.

08-28-04 : When looking at a creature with spy activated there is a chance
           to increase your spy level.  Spy must be active for this to work.

08-28-04 : The assist command will now automatically assist the first person
           in your group involved in a fight, when no argument is given.

08-26-04 : Advanced adventuring trainer is now in.  You can find the clue
           at the usual places.

08-26-04 : Any class may now whittle bows and arrows.

08-24-04 : Added an advanced adventuring discipline.  This discipline is
           20 pracs, available to all classes, and containts a few skills
           formerly belonging to rangers.  It requires that the Adventuring
           discipline be learned to a high level first.  There isn't a 
           trainer yet, but there will be soon.

08-24-04 : The concealment skill has been moved to the Stealth discipline.
           The track skill has been moved to the Thief discipline.

08-24-04 : Changed the few remaining non-thief bows to be usable by thieves.

08-24-04 : Added a "set arrow trap" skill to the traps discipline.  This
           allows you to set most of the standard trap types on arrows,
           that trigger when the arrow hits.

08-21-04 : Casting from the wrist should now work.

08-20-04 : The Blunt, Pierce, Slash and Ranged Specialization disciplines 
           have been added to all classes.

08-17-04 : Player corpses are no longer saved with special code, but now
           rely on the standard room saving code.  This means that you
           can now also rent player corpses.

08-16-04 : Fixed a very old bug in Inverse Grimhaven.  Access to the theater
           is now possible.

08-15-04 : Walking barefoot while levitating should no longer hurt your feet.

08-13-04 : Disease should no longer spread in peaceful rooms.

08-13-04 : Rescue without any arguments will now default to the first person
           tanking in your current group.  You and the person tanking must
           both be grouped for this to work.

08-02-04 : You can now ask the fishmaster 'score' to get a listing of your
           personal fishing scores.

08-02-04 : Immortal mobiles should no longer gain hatreds for players.

07-31-04 : Changed fishing exp formula to be level based - in theory you
           could fish your way to level 50.

07-31-04 : Potions don't glow anymore.

07-31-04 : You can now pour liquids into the mouths of unconscious
           people.  Sleeping doesn't count.

07-31-04 : You can now practice the adventure discipline if you want.
           There's not much reason to do this unless you're a pacifist.

07-31-04 : Player corpses don't go into quick decay when empty now.

07-31-04 : Rate of tool loads has been reduced.

07-31-04 : Knocked out teeth are rentable now (really).  Fix a small
           memory leak with knocked out teeth as well.

07-31-04 : Heart rip crit now leaves heart in your hand.

07-31-04 : You can now use diagonal abbreviations with search.

07-31-04 : Talen piles now merge automatically.

07-31-04 : Chalk now loads in colored variants.

07-31-04 : Poisoned weapons now work with backstab and slit.

07-31-04 : The last changes with talens was reverted due to unexpected bugs.

07-28-04 : Talens are now handled like real objects, kept in your inventory,
           bags, etc.  You will still see a talen count in your prompt and
           in score, which is a tally of talens in your inventory.  This is
           a fairly complex change, so there may be some bugs.  In the future
           we may be able to have various denominations of talen, as well
           possibly adding other currencies.  As a result of this conversion,
           all of your talens have been moved to your bank account (in
           Grimhaven if you previously didn't have one).

07-25-04 : 'score' will now show what your maximum experience was since
           before your last death.  If your current exp is higher than it
           was it will not show it.

07-19-04 : You will now see the item and it's condition in your prompt when
           repairing.

07-19-04 : When viewing a room in brief mode you will now see closed exits
           regardless of your perception, just like in non-brief mode.

07-14-04 : Minor changes made to critical hitting.  You can no longer remove
           the hearts of Skeletons, sever the tendons of Skeletons/Ghosts or
           like critical hits.  This affects Ghosts, Zombies and Skeletons.
           Also zombie hearts will now have poison, not blood, so be wary
           you bloodlusters.

07-14-04 : "eval room" now shows if you are inside or outside.

07-12-04 : Withdraw all and deposit all should work at the bank again.

07-02-04 : Trash collection mobs should no longer 'collect' things being
           used, such as sleeping bags.

07-02-04 : Minor adjustment to the 'chi corpse' messages when the corpse
           is already burning.  Also adjusted the failure message for said
           chi situation to be a bit more logical.

07-01-04 : The output of scan is now colorized.

06-20-04 : Weapons with the fireball proc should no longer cause the mud
           to crash.

06-19-04 : Mobiles will no longer ride mounts following you.

06-19-04 : The postman will no longer get caught in a loop when trying to
           deliver a letter to a shop while mounted.

06-17-04 : Dissect will now search the room first and your inventory second.

06-17-04 : The people have spoken and the old deathcry message has been put
           back in place.

06-17-04 : Adjustments to the new ansi/vt100 bar to better span the information
           across the screen area.  Also fixed the dangling tank in said bar.

06-15-04 : Any class based quests missed before gaining level 50 are now
           doable.

06-12-04 : Some fixes and internal changes to the shaman sacrifice code.
           Let Maror know if something unexpected happens.

06-10-04 : Removed tax for player selling, still taxed for shop selling.

06-10-04 : The King has decided on a 5% sales tax for all shop transactions.
           The tax is paid automatically by shopkeepers on both sales and
           purchases.  The proceeds will be used to buy expensive beer for
           the King.  And maybe the High Tabuda, if he isn't busy.  And some
           hookers.  And pipeweed.

06-10-04 : The Union of Sweepers and Collectors and the Grimhaven Coroner
           Group have reached a division of labor agreement with respect to
           corpses.

06-03-04 : Recoded the way item stacking works a little bit.  It should work
           better now.  Let me (Peel) know if you find items that are the same
           but aren't stacking correctly.

06-01-04 : While striking an opponent in battle you will now have a slim
           chance of increasing the appropriate 'know' skill.  This only
           pertains to standard combat swings and then only if they do
           damage.

06-01-04 : Corporate bank accounts are now actually stored in the banks.
           This doesn't affect anything really, except the total talens in
           the banks.  All corporations were set to use the GH Bank as their
           corporate bank, let me know if you want to change yours.  You
           still access the bank account through the corporate assistant.

05-27-04 : The Grimhaven dump no longer gives out a reward for dumped items.
           However, a new waste disposal pipe has been installed under GH,
           and any items on the dump are swept through the pipe out to the
           river.  If you dump something by accident, you can go swimming
           after it!

05-27-04 : The banks of the world have been privatized!  Sort of.  The
           four main banks are now corporations and are now totally
           seperate from each other.  This means your bank account is
           stored as part of the bank it is at, rather than your pfile.
           Everyone that has money in the bank has been given a free account
           at the Grimhaven bank and had their money transfered there.

05-25-04 : Item limits have been removed on all items except for unique,
           or artifact, items.

05-24-04 : Shop owners may now change the response strings of their
           shopkeepers.  See shop owner help file for details.

05-23-04 : Pets now use their masters trophy settings when gaining exp.

05-23-04 : Had to do a file conversion for pets.  All pets were lost.
           *mourn*

05-21-04 : Mobs can now gain exp and level, just like players.  This includes
           pets!  Please let me know if this turns out to be too exploitable.

05-20-04 : Expanded object persistency to the entire game.

05-20-04 : Player planted plants now grow old and die.

05-18-04 : Offal decays much faster now.

05-18-04 : Redid how the in-room object loader works.  There shouldn't be
           any change, but if you notice excess or missing in-room loads,
           you may want to bug it or let an imm know.

05-18-04 : Mobs in the world have recently become very frightened of dragons.
           If they happen to be in the same room when a dragon uses its breath
           weapon, they are now very likely to flee before they get hit by it.

05-13-04 : We're trying a little experiment: objects will now save over
           reboots, in most of the rooms in Grimhaven.  No-rent objects
           won't save, but anything else sitting on the ground will.
           I have no idea if this is a good idea or not, but I figured
           we'd try it out and see what people think.

05-11-04 : Food style liquid containers no longer decay.

05-05-04 : Trophy is now scaled based on the number of each mob that loads.
           In other words, you will trophy 10 times slower on a mob if 
           there are 10 copies of that mob loading, rather than 1.

04-16-04 : A stock listing board has been added to the bank lobby,
           temporarily.  I will continue development on the stock market
           concept and hopefully you will be able to purchase stocks soon.

04-13-04 : The Grimhaven-Brightmoon trolley now has an engineer and runs
           much faster than before.

04-13-04 : A loan shop has been opened, located in the Grimhaven Bank.
           You can get a loan offer by typing "list" and take out a loan
           by typing "buy loan" or "buy loan <amount>".

04-13-04 : The corporate offices have been moved to the Grimhaven Bank.
           You can get information on the various corporations by using
           "list" and "list number" in the room with the corporate assistant.

03-30-04 : Equipment and money sharing between your characters is now
           permitted.  All other multiplay rules remain in effect.

03-29-04 : Powerstones no longer hold a charge, but just add to your max
           mana.

03-28-04 : Removed class restriction on charging powerstones.  Powerstones
           now contribute directly to mana, as shown in score and your
           prompt.

03-16-04 : Disarm is now a 'dangerous' skill, which means that it will fail
           more often.

03-10-04 : Added some more data to the trophy board in the morgue.

02-28-04 : Slight increase in the rate of opal charging using 'chi'.

02-28-04 : Added some minimal constraints to trip.  I doubt many of you will
           run into them in your epic battles, but there ya go.

02-28-04 : Internal change to processing of spaces in text.  Should be fine,
           but please bug Maror if something weird turns up.

02-28-04 : Checks for 'are you immune or not' now work in a straightforward
           way.

02-26-04 : Fixed listing in 'prac frog' of what forms a shaman is able to shift
           into.  Shamans are limited by both level and skill at shapeshift, as
           previously.

02-26-04 : Lycanthropes will transform only when it is both night and the moon
           is up.

02-24-04 : Famine will no longer mess with your potions.

02-21-04 : You can now vandalize the mud with chalk.  We'll see how it goes...

02-19-04 : Shop owners must now pay a salary to their shopkeepers.  See
           shop ownership helpfile for details.

02-19-04 : Two shop ownership changes: First, it is no longer allowed to set
           the profit_buy ratio lower than the profit_sell ratio.  We've had
           a few incidents of screwups costing people large sums of cash, and
           there's really no legitimate reason to do this on purpose.  Second,
           you can now set pricing ratios on a per player basis, so you can
           make things really expensive for Dyehead.  Just as an example.

02-18-04 : New monk skill: catleap

02-18-04 : Fixed the periodic spell component loader.  Stuff should load now
           like it used to long ago.  The fertile soil in Brazzed-Dum has
           begun growing more mushrooms lately.  When components that decay
           merge together, the decay rate of the resulting component will be
           calculated using the weighted average of the charges.

02-14-04 : Shops:  Maurice ran low on funds, as no one ever purchased anything
           from him, and has lowered his buy prices.  Potions should now
           be sellable.  Changed some of the code involved in item values to
           make potions work - should all be fine, but bug Maror if anything
           seems odd.

02-13-04 : You're not going to believe this, seriously.  At some point in
           time, someone *cough Batopr* removed the attack bonus for
           advanced kicking for monks and never accounted for it anywhere.
           So, henceforth, advanced kicking now grants an extra attack.
           Happy Friday the 13th!  *mutter*

02-13-04 : Higher level mage mobs that can't fly and are hunting will now cast
           flight on themselves before they go looking for their quarry.
           Vampire mobs are now quite a bit less likely to perform their
           dreaded bloodsucking bite, and the victim gets a chance to save
           against the attack.

02-12-04 : Thief mobs will now occasionally load trap components.

02-10-04 : Monk changes.  Fixed a bug with iron body where an incorrect
           AC bonus was given to characters using paired items (e.g. pants).
           Slightly improved the ability to yoginsa without food and water
           for very skilled practitioners of wohlin.

02-10-04 : Added 'group lots' command.  For those who want to group more.
           (That's not really it - read the helpfile).

02-08-04 : Fixed bug where paired item effects disappeared.

02-08-04 : Disabled age effects on line of sight, regen, and base moves.
           Disabled age effects on movement while flying.

02-05-04 : The frankenstein games have begun.
           http://sneezy.saw.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1646&highlight=

02-02-04 : The King has picked up the tab on the limb and corpse collector
           in Grimhaven.  So beat those zombies to the action!

02-01-04 : It's now much harder to disarm a shield.  Mobs will also think
           twice before trying.

01-28-04 : All affects of age have been disabled.  No more movement
           penalties and no more stat changes, until further notice.

01-28-04 : Player killing and player looting are now against the rules.
           HELP PLOOT and HELP PKILL have been updated.

01-23-04 : Made many internal changes to the main game loop to help
           regulate CPU usage.  Hopefully we should be running smoother now,
           and with less overall lag.

01-23-04 : Burning is now about 3 times as slow as before.

01-13-04 : A magical sweepstakes is sweeping the land.

01-10-04 : The guard command is now active again.  PC pets will no longer
           rescue you automatically, unless you order them to turn guard
           mode on.

01-08-04 : Heal spray spells will now heal within groups only.

01-08-04 : Potion shops no longer carry unlimited potions.  To offset
           this, mobs now load what were previously unlimited potions.
           This is a random load on all mobs based on level, much like
           commodities.

01-07-04 : Rewrote how the zones command calculates average level.  It
           should now be more accurate - input needed on this please!
           (It now displays the average level of mobs in the zone that
           are within 1 standard deviation of the overall average level
           of mobs in the zone, in case you were wondering).

01-07-04 : Rewrote much of the mob pathfinding code.  Not entirely sure
           what affect this will have, but be wary.  Mobs may be tracking
           much more intelligently (but not any faster or slower).

01-06-04 : Scrapped liquid containers will now dump their contents into
	   the room.

01-05-04 : Mobs will now track through portals.

01-05-04 : Fixed the infinite poo bug.

01-04-04 : Fixed problem with curse.

01-04-04 : Removed number-of-attackers limitations on combat skills and spells.

01-03-04 : Stupidity is now an offensive spell.

01-02-04 : Improved likelihood of cursing your opponent.

01-02-04 : Re-added a bonus for advanced learning in level comparison checks.
           This is an interim change pending further adjustments.  Advanced
           disciplines will continue to be important.

01-02-04 : Curse and faerie fire are now offensive spells.

12-31-03 : Fumble, calm, and silence are now offensive spells.

12-31-03 : Disarm can now sometimes affects mobs of higher level.  So can other
           skills.  Level comparisons in general work a little differently.
           Bug Maror if something is working a LOT less than it should.  Bug
           Bump if you just want to bitch about it.

12-31-03 : Feral wrath no longer gives hp as a bonus.  This is a hitting spell,
           after all.

12-29-03 : Clarified error message for rangers casting in combat.  Note:
           rangers must have their components held in their hands to cast
           in combat.

12-29-03 : Shamans can now evaluate comps to determine what spell they are
           used for.

12-28-03 : fixed some typos

12-28-03 : lockout for thief disguise no longer increases with increasing level

12-28-03 : spell effects that change AC will now affect mobs

12-28-03 : Polymorph/shapechange/disguise/lycanthropy/vampiricism changes: name
           retention, trophy retention, forced return when spell runs out, 
           AC/hp/damage corrections, keep spells when switching, don't reset 
           quest skills when switching, fixed moves, fixed riding bug, fixed 
           experience reset bug, fixed a bunch of crash bugs

12-28-03 : Started making some equipment changes.  Don't be surprised if
           something is better, worse, or fits different classes.

12-25-03 : Added some new smoke dynamics, so that smoke will drift around
           now.

12-25-03 : The Grimhaven Fire Department has stepped up their fire prevention
           activities and deployed more firemen.

12-19-03 : Additional features for corporations, details in the (new)
           corporation help file and the shop owner help file.

12-15-03 : Added a dividend kickback option to owned shops.  More details
           in 'help shop owner'.

12-15-03 : Changed the way unlimited items work in shops.  From a customer
           point of view, it is pretty much the same.  For shop owners:
           You will no longer get "wholesale" prices for buying unlimited
           items.  You will also no longer have to pay to produce the
           items - unless you only have one left.  In other words,
           unlimited items are just like other items, except when you 
           hit 1 item, in which case you pay to produce them so you
           don't run out.

12-15-03 : Disabled transform for now, due to a bug with it messing up
           your exp.

12-05-03 : Added some beta code for corporations.  Some info is available
           in the new corporate offices above the inn.
           P.S. Peel's birthday is coming up soon.

11-27-03 : No trophy, double exp, no repop, increase POS, POY and POL
           loads, for Turkey Day.  Enjoy!

11-15-03 : Gimped crit hitting and power move slightly.

11-15-03 : It turns out that iron fist and the voplat damage bonus weren't
           working at all - fixed.

11-13-03 : Changed component shops to deal in units of charges.  You can now
           buy 5*component to get a component with 5 charges on it.  Same with
           selling.  The shopkeepers will enforce inventory limits on the total
           number of charges of each component.
           Also, you can do: sell 25*all.comp to sell up to 25 charges of every
           component in your inventory, provided your comps have that many
           charges and the shopkeeper's inventory limit isn't reached.
           Scribe has been fixed.  You can now do: scribe 3*haste to get 3
           haste scrolls.  All 3 will be rentable because 3 charges from each
           of the required components will have been consumed.

11-08-03 : By the way, so you don't have to buy an expensive spell component
           with hundreds of charges on it from a shop, you can do:
           buy 5*component to purchase an appropriately priced component
           with 5 charges on it.

11-08-03 : Spell components that are added into something that already
           contains a similar component will now automatically be merged into
           a single component that is the sum of the two.  To split a
           component up, do: "split component #-of-charges" on a component
           that's in your inventory.  The new component will be inserted
           after the old one, so repeated split commands will work more
           conveniently.

11-05-03 : New characters now start off with a base number of practices.

11-04-03 : Put in some code to alleviate lag when players log in with
           a large number of objects *cough mages*.

11-04-03 : Added a new crit type for monks with critical hitting.

11-03-03 : Gaining levels is now done automatically when you gain exp.
           You now learn your basic class training at your guildmaster,
           rather than the old trainers.  You also need to see your
           guildmaster for any quest information.

11-03-03 : Teeth can now be rented.

10-27-03 : Ok, level 50's no longer need to be set by hand.  It will
           be done automatically.  Cheers.

10-27-03 : Practices are now gained based on experience rather than
           level and you will gain them automatically as you gain
           experience.  Additionally, you can now gain practices past
           level 50 simply by continuing to acrue experience.  The
           post-50 practices will be gained on the same experience curve
           as if you had continued leveling.  The 1.3 billion experience
           point cap has been removed.  Current level 50's may have their
           experience reset to 1 billion, however you MUST ASK BEFORE
           you gain a single point of experience, OTHERWISE YOUR EXPERIENCE
           WILL NOT BE RESET.  I suggest you remain in the inn until
           an immortal can reset your experience.  Enjoy.

10-16-03 : Relive no longer has a permanent aging penalty.  Rejoice.

10-12-03 : Disguise, polymorph, and shapeshift will no longer result
           in a move bonus.  Shapeshift will preserve life force now -
           this may be revoked, or shapeshift revised, if it proves
           too beneficial.

10-08-03 : Upped rent item limit to 10k again.  Last time, this caused
           crashes, but I want to give it another go.  Perhaps we can
           work through the bugs.

10-06-03 : Many internal changes, probably a few bugs.  Be wary.

10-02-03 : The total weight of your worn eq is now displayed in the
           equipment command.

10-02-03 : The trophy board in the morgue no longer uses total mob count
           for percentages.  Instead, it compares everyone to the leader,
           currently Frobozz.

10-01-03 : Trophy now ignores mobs that don't load.

09-25-03 : Fixed an error in mob hp calculation.  Mobs between level 71
           and 82 will no longer be pre-chewed.

09-24-03 : The learning rate on read magic has been adjusted.  Recite
           now consumes the scroll if you fail the read magic check.
           Recite now causes lag equal to the spell that the scroll
           cases.  Scribe now does a read magic check.  Mages now get
           a 50% bonus to read magic when reciting.

09-19-03 : Internal changes to and cleaning up of response scripts.  Many
           scripts were modified - bug Maror if there's a problem.

09-09-03 : A cure for lycanthropy has been added.

09-09-03 : Many of the roads in the world have been greatly extended and
           the world has been generally more spread out.  This will 
	   facilitate the addition of more zones (we were getting rather
	   cramped) as well as possible thematic rearrangment in the near
           future.  It should also provide a greater sense of distance 
	   and realism.

08-21-03 : Added a garbageman to the GH dump.  He will buy some items,
           such as armor, clothing, weapons and jewelry for premium
           over the normal dump pay out.  Over time, he will recycle
           these objects, selling them for raw materials, and thus
           refilling his cash, allowing more items to be bought.  This
           is an experimental measure to stimulate the economy.

08-19-03 : Vampirism and lycanthropy are now in the game.  Note that
           there is currently no cure for lycanthropy - be careful
           around those were-creatures!

08-16-03 : Inventory can be seen now if you have true sight, even if
           blinded.

08-12-03 : Fixed problems with brew.  It should work reasonably well
           now.

08-12-03 : Added new AI code for monk and mage mobs.  They will now
           do some new things during combat, etc.  Also, critical hits
           will no longer necessarily scrap equipment.  When someone
           gets a tooth knocked out, others in the room will now see
           who made the hit.  Fixed a few miscellaneous typos.
	   
07-31-03 : Added a Texas Hold'em table to the casino.  Currently you
           must play with other players, but I will eventually add
           a couple of house AI players (hopefully).  This game is
           probably very buggy.

07-25-03 : Buying iced tea at Sestrel's will no longer result in
           a glass of milk.

07-22-03 : Added vampire and vampire bat mob races.
           No vampirism as of yet.

07-21-03 : Repair tickets will now become invalid after 180 days.

07-17-03 : You will no longer hit innocents in the same room as you
           with ranged attacks.

07-16-03 : I've put in a bag shop where portable holes, bags of holding
           and a few other new bags may be purchased.  Please do not
           ask me where the shop is - it will be found eventually.
           There is a small quest required to enter the shop.

07-15-03 : Increased ranged damage and decreased chance to hit innocents.

07-15-03 : Increased monk damage a bit.  This is an experimental change.

07-14-03 : Changed the format of the owned shop "logs summaries" command.

07-10-03 : The GK Highrollers Casino now sells scratch lottery tickets.
           The tickets may be purchased at the cashier's cage and
           redeemed with the casino pit boss.

07-02-03 : Consider and evaluate are now more accurate.

06-25-03 : Added a "show saves" toggle, that will give you a "Saving."
           message everytime your pfile is saved if it is toggled on.

06-19-03 : Added peeing and pooping.  Yeah.

06-10-03 : Added a utility to allow shop owners to download shop logs
           in comma delimited format.  Read "help shop own" to see
           how to set a password with the access command, then visit
	   http://sneezy.saw.net/shoplog.cgi to download shop logs.

05-29-03 : Fixed a bunch of typos.

05-24-03 : Playing around with shadowwalk a little.  The shadowwalker
           will become visible when shadows in the room become too
           scarce to walk across - ie brightly lit and above.

05-02-03 : Made several small changes to the world map for consistency.
           You may find that some paths have changed slightly and that
           some speedwalks may not work.

04-23-03 : Copy only works on spells that the cast knows now.

04-23-03 : Word of recall will no longer work in no-portal rooms.

04-23-03 : Ranged damage has been increased.

04-23-03 : Disguise and polymorph no longer protect you from mobs that
           totally aggro.  No change has been made to mobs that are not
           normally aggressive.

04-17-03 : Added about 15 new fish types for fishing.

04-14-03 : Did some optimizing and re-design on the shop ownership database
           code.  The lag you get when you type "list" at big shops should
           be greatly reduced.

04-14-03 : Re-designed the boot time object caching routine to use the
           cache for more objects.  This should reduce the boot time
           considerably.  Also, welcome to the new server. :)

03-20-03 : The fishing boat code has been rewritten.  Enjoy.

03-13-03 : Huge sweeping internal changes that will probably result in
           a few bugs.  Sorry.  It's really for the best in the long run.

03-12-03 : Added fortune cookies.  Let Peel know if you want one.

02-28-03 : Fixed up reply a little bit, should work better on disguised
           people and mobs that immortals are switched into.

02-26-03 : New shaman spell: embalm

02-21-03 : Brew has been re-enabled.

02-20-03 : Rolled back the part of the internal changes that I think was
           causing the bugs.  Everything should be ok now.

02-18-03 : Small change to sacrifice. Read the help file.

02-14-03 : Made a whole lot of internal changes.  Let me know if something
           isn't working, mainly regarding command arguments.

02-14-03 : Fixed up shop max_num stuff.  Many items weren't being restricted
           by the shop max, but they will be now.  Taloc, for example, has
           over 3000 ball pein hammers, which is incorrect.

02-11-03 : Symbol shops will now purchase holy water vials, but only if
           they are full and (obviously) contain holy water.

02-11-03 : Fixed a TON of typos.  The typo file is practically empty.
           Rejoice.

02-10-03 : Mucked around with how exp is represented internally.  You may
           find that exp values are shifted slightly.  It should be very
           minor.

02-07-03 : New thief skill 'plant' in the looting disc is now in.

02-07-03 : Thief shops will now buy/sell poisons.  Other shops will not.

01-19-03 : Added a 'poison arrow' skill for rangers.

01-03-03 : The doctor will now cure poison.  Also, several small bug
           fixes have been made.

12-30-02 : I should point out that the conversion of poisons and
           potions to true liquids combined with the rewrite of the
           poison weapon skill now allows you to poison a weapon with
           ANY liquid.  Mundane liquids like water or beer won't do
           anything... but potions will.

12-29-02 : Added a "(empty)" string to liquid containers that are empty.

12-29-02 : Rewrote the method for poisoning weapons to work better with
           liquid poisons.  You can now poison a weapon with any liquid
           type, although only poisons will have any actual affect.

12-29-02 : Poisons have been converted to be true liquid types.
           Everything should work pretty much the same, except now you 
           can move the poison around, hold it in a water skin, drink
           it, etc.  The company assumes no responsibility should you
           choose to drink poison.

12-28-02 : All fountains have been converted to normal liquid containers.

12-28-02 : Rewrote the walking-around-barefoot stumble code to be less
           of a pain in the ass.

12-28-02 : Removed slipping-on-offal proc.

12-15-02 : Evaluate has been integrated into look.  Whenever you look
           at something (except rooms) you will receive the additional
           evaluate information as well.  In most cases, it's only 3
           extra lines, but if it is too spammy, I can put in an
           auto-eval toggle.

12-14-02 : You can now mail "faction" to send bulk mail to everyone in
           your faction.  The cost is 5000 talens.

12-08-02 : All potions have been converted to true liquid types now.
           This means you can pour them out, fill up water skins with
           them, sip them, etc.  Brew has been temporarily disabled
           until I can rewrite it to use the new potion type.  There
           are probably some bugs to work out.

12-06-02 : Tattoos are now displayed as "Tattooed on .." instead of
           "Worn on .." as they were.  They also show up red instead
           of cyan.

12-04-02 : The travel agent in Amber now sells passes for Serpents to
           travel to Logrus.

11-27-02 : Rewrote the cleric symbol loader, so there should be a lot
           more symbols loading.  I've also removed the unlimited symbols
           from the shop - it is up to players to stock them now.

11-27-02 : You can now use the setrates command to clear ratios for
           individual items or keywords.  See helpfile for examples.
           Also, setting max_num of 0 for an item or a keyword will
           cause no items of that type to be purchased (previously
           it was allowing 1 item to be purchased).

11-24-02 : Materialize and spontaneous generation have been re-enabled, but
           now only work for a very small range of items.

11-24-02 : Setting max num for owned shops should work now.  It might be
           a little buggy, so keep your eyes out.  Ditto with the matching.

11-24-02 : Materialize and spontaneous generation have been disabled
           pending a rewrite.

11-23-02 : Keyword matching for shop profit ratios should be working now.

11-22-02 : Consolidated "set profit_buy" and "set profit_sell" into a new
           command, "setrates".  "shop owner" help file has been updated,
           read it for syntax. max_num and keyword matching are not currently
           functional.

11-21-02 : Fixed a bug with the display of shop logs - you should be able
           to see your logs correctly now, no matter how long they are.

11-20-02 : New shaman ritual in the healing discipline. See help
           ENLIVEN for details.

11-20-02 : You should not be able to tell the difference between a
           successfully poisoned weapon and an unsuccessfully poisoned
           weapon now.

11-20-02 : You can now specify a poison with poison weapon.

11-15-02 : Poisoned arrows now work correctly.

11-15-02 : Reimplemented the mystery potion. Like before, it may be good
           or it may be bad. Quaff at your own risk etc.

11-15-02 : You can poison magic weapons now.  Be aware that some poisons
           may not function to full affect with used with some weapons.

11-15-02 : Added several new poisons for poison weapon, which will load
           on thief mobs.

11-14-02 : Added a crit fail to poison weapon.  Increased the affect
           of poison weapon.  Poison weapon overhaul in progress,
           more to come.

11-14-02 : Fixed some bugs with the mystic man below Camron's.  He
           should always give back items now.

11-12-02 : Rewrote the practice distribution function for mobs.  Rather
           than just randomly practicing disciplines, they will now be
           a little bit smarter about it.  For example, the same mob
           may load as either a fire mage or a water mage, depending
           on what they "decide" when they load.  Also, fixed a dumb
           bug with toggle.  And I added something else, but it's a
           secret.

11-11-02 : Totally rewrote the practice calculation formula.  I also
           fixed a huge bug with mob pracs in the process.  Mobs 
	   (particularly mages) will have a lot less pracs - in fact,
           they should have pracs appropriate for their levels.
           You may notice a slight change in the number of pracs you
           get as a player.  Also, intelligence now has a greater
           affect on practices.

11-06-02 : Added a trip skill for warriors. Help file is there but
           come on, I think you know what tripping someone is.

11-02-02 : Added "group name".

11-02-02 : "Prac stealth" no longer shows a list of valid disguises.
           Disguise with no arguments will show a list of valid
           disguises - and it's actually accurate now.

11-01-02 : Fixed some bugs with special attacks code.  Cudgel uses a
           different hitting mechanism now, I'm not sure how the hit
           rate will be affected.

10-30-02 : Ranged specialization and fast load now allow for multiple
           shots in quick succession.

10-30-02 : Mobs that have been made wary now have a better chance of
           avoiding arrows.  This is similar to how backstab works.

10-30-02 : Fixed a bunch of crash bugs.

10-24-02 : Redid the ranged damage formula slightly.  Previously, if
           you had a low ranged proficiency, you would get a damage
           penalty.  That penalty is gone, so lower level rangers
           should do more damage.

10-23-02 : Few shaman tweaks. There are some other features that have 
           become random somehow with shaman that I will address as I
           can. 

10-23-02 : Evaluate was too slow to increase and it doesn't make sense 
           that evaluate and examine give you alot of the same infor-
           mation SO I will examine and evaluate evaluate and examine
           and possibly change them to make the evaluate skill a bit
           more worth learning for non-casting classes. I also increased
           the learn rate on evaluate a little.

10-18-02 : The tattoo artist in Amber now sells tattoos.

10-17-02 : Maror was kind enough to point out that the global shop price
           modifier was still in place for owned shops - that is, your
           profit_sell modifier was being changed transparently by the
           mud.  This has been removed.  You may wish to re-examine the
           price of items in your shop as this will cause a global
           decrease in price of about 41%.

10-15-02 : Mud is now using dynamically linked libraries rather than
           statically linked objects.  I don't expect any problems to
           arise but I thought you'd like to know.

10-15-02 : Removed a damage bonus from archery.  A multiplier of up to
           500% was being added, depending on range.  I think this is
           the cause of ranged damage being so high.

10-15-02 : 'shoot' now works as described in the help file - if you shoot
           in a direction without specifying a target, you will shoot
           at the first target in that direction.

10-14-02 : The news command can now take an argument to search entries.

10-10-02 : Fixed a bug with weapon damage, a big one.  Pierce and slash
           weapons should be doing a lot more damage now.

10-09-02 : The disease prayer will now only inflict a disease if the
           victim does not already have the disease.

09-13-02 : Disabled repo.  Yay!

09-09-02 : Monks with iron skin suffer less chance of hurting themselves
           when running around without gear.

09-05-02 : Hobbits will no longer break their feet if they don't wear
	   shoes.

09-04-02 : Fixed a crash bug in conceal.

09-04-02 : Changed butcher to take the size of the corpse into account
           when determining how much food you get out of it.

09-04-02 : Cudgeled cityguards will no longer try to assist themselves 
	   (or others)

09-04-02 : Made elementals a lil weaker again.

08-28-02 : Deaths up to and including level 10 no longer result in
           any age gain.  Cheers.

08-28-02 : The Grimhaven Casino has bankrupted and closed it's doors.  Word
           has it that two prominent investors are planning on rebuilding.

08-27-02 : Added tell history to the history command.

08-22-02 : Removed bank deposit limits.

08-09-02 : Removed ensorcer.  But I also made it so you can get 2 thralls
           at upper levels and even 3 at high high levels if you're
           charismatic.  Elementals are also a bit buffer and vary from type
           to type more, in terms of offensive/defensive capability.

08-09-02 : Fixed a crash bug in repair.

08-09-02 : Containers that are empty will display (empty), but only if they
           are currently open (so you can easily see the contents, or lack of).

08-08-02 : Disabled junk command.  If you want to get rid of something, take
           it to the dump, or just throw it on the ground like the no-good
           littering slob that you are.  Nojunk still works, and will protect
           from certain things like accidentily dropping at the dump etc.

08-08-02 : Put in most of the repair objs.  Big thankye to Maror for doing
           them for lazy me.

08-08-02 : Calmed mobs can now use special moves/cast etc if they are
           fighting, but they can't initiate anything on their own.

08-06-02 : Changed the max charmie/thrall etc to one.

07-29-02 : Added actual drink types to all the drinks in Kavod's shop.

07-27-02 : Added brief and compact to the toggle command.  Reformated the
           toggle list to fit more toggles on a line.

07-19-02 : Fixed my 'tweak' of fastload.  Ha ha.  (oops)

07-17-02 : Changed Order of the Snakes leader names, per faction
           request.

07-16-02 : Lowered rent limit back 1k, it was causing problems.

07-15-02 : Fixed a crash bug thats been haunting us.

07-15-02 : Tweaked fastload for rangers.  Should be faster than it was
	   before, but I slowed down normal loading for rangers, so the
           change sorta favors rangers.  As it should.

07-13-02 : Fix a bunch of bugs.  See SneezyMUD forums for details
           (http://www.grimhaven.org/phpBB2/)
	   Some of what was fixed: charmed clerics not healing masters,
	   polymorph resetting quest skills, idle repo mobs, various
           sacrifice bugs, switching/rescuing mob bug, a really big
           ruler, flying/bash quirks, innkeepers pushing people around,
           and the room description of some whittled objects.
           Cheers.

07-13-02 : Players can now fly during combat, mobs who can't see
           invis will no longer bash invis clerics or mages or whatever.

07-13-02 : Tweaked some of the wrath cleric prayers.

07-12-02 : Added a couple of new fish to catch.

07-10-02 : You can use springleap to initiate combat now.

07-07-02 : Added a new toggle: trophy.  When on, you will see your trophy
           status for mobs that you kill automatically.

07-05-02 : Added new crit type.

07-04-02 : Cut repair costs, cut damage rates, removed depreciation.
	   Put wear and tear back in, and lengthened repair times.

07-04-02 : Added a bunch of repair skills for all the classes, and an
	   advanced repair skill for warriors.  Also a mend skill in
       	   basic adventuring, but its disabled.  None of this really
           matters though, because the tools aren't in the game yet.
           Enjoy!

07-04-02 : Added a 'ping' toggle.  It will be off by default.  If you want
           the mud to ping you to determine your network lag (as shown in
           the 'world' command), then you need to toggle this on.  If
           you've got a really slow connection or if you're playing in
           a "sensitive" environment (read: not allowed to mud at work)
           then you may wish to leave it off.

07-02-02 : Monks have been tweaked somewhat.  Blur will now trigger more
           often, critical hitting will cause more damage, voplat will
           cause more damage, wohlin meditation will increase healing
           rate and there is a new skill: chain attack.

06-30-02 : Grapple tweaked slightly.

06-29-02 : Second attempt at object caching to increase boot speed.  Seems
           to be working ok and cuts off about 2 minutes.

06-27-02 : Adjusted object burning/freezing/acid dissolving again.  The
           chances are much lower now without a protection spell and
           extremely low with a protection spell.

06-22-02 : New mage spell: knot.

06-19-02 : Consolidated auto, terminal, flag  and wimpy into the toggle
           command.

06-13-02 : Increased rent item limit from 1k to 10k.

06-12-02 : Several changes to smythe based on Laren's feedback.

06-12-02 : Made some changes to the way weight and volume are calculated.

06-07-02 : Receiving a tell will no longer break meditation.  Who's idea was
           that anyway?

06-06-02 : Multiple weapon types are now in.

06-06-02 : Turned on rent deletion for 3 month inactive players but ONLY
           if every character in the players account is inactive.

06-04-02 : In order to encourage Grimhaven's economic growth, the King has
           ordered that the slums be demolished and a new market district be
           built in its place.  Although no shops have taken up residence in
           the new area yet, new owners are expected to move in soon.  See
           the message board for details.

06-04-02 : Added the ability to have multiple weapon types.  We have two
           builders working on actually setting weapons with multiple types,
           so you won't see any change as of yet.  This code move is to make
           sure that the supporting code functions correctly.  Please keep
           an eye out for odd weapon types, incorrect proficiency hones, etc.

05-22-02 : Added a toggle for fun....you'll see :)

05-20-02 : Ok the caching thing didn't work at all, back to the drawing board.

05-20-02 : I added a smoove object caching trick to the boot time zone
           resetting.  This should give us a huge decrease in boot time, but
           we'll have to try it out and see.  It works pretty well on beta.

05-20-02 : Re-wrote the mail system to use the database.  I removed about 380
           lines of ancient file I/O routines and replaced them with about 10
           lines of database code.  Just thought you'd like to know.  Let's
           hope it actually works.  Any mail not received by the time this
           change goes in will be lost.  Sorry.

05-08-02 : Bags won't burn now.  This code was already in, but it wasn't
           working right I guess.

04-25-02 : Added a new disc for monks: iron body.  Before you ask, no, there
           won't be any practice reimbursements or shuffling or anything.

04-25-02 : Added new skill for mages, in the magic lore discipline, called
           mana.  As you might expect, mage mana is now determined by this
           skill instead of level.  If you're a mage give me (Peel) a tell
           I'll set your skill up a bit.

04-24-02 : Renamed some of the logrus faction leader slots, per faction
           request.

03-25-02 : Charmed clerics will only heal thier masters.

03-19-02 : Tweaked mage elementals to be stronger hitters, worse tanks.

03-18-02 : Apparently people weren't enjoying the repo code as much as
	   I'd hoped.  Disabled.  Normal repo (max exist repoes) remain
	   unchanged, as before.

03-18-02 : 2nd bump in monster level.

03-16-02 : Added the money train.  Choo choo.

03-12-02 : Modified the shop logs a bit.  All negative cost logs will now
           actually be recorded as negative cost (shop sells an item, cost
           is positive, shop buys an item, cost is negative).  Added a
           balance sheet to logs summaries.  Added 3 additional shop logs:
           repo, producing (price paid for producing an unlimited item),
           and wholesale (price gained for buy a produced item).  Added
           the ability to see logs for particular players (eg logs peel).

03-11-02 : Fixed a bunch of issues with repo - including mobs attacking
	   prematurely, mobs that can't speak repoing, etc.  Lowbies
	   will also not be killed, as will afk people.  If you try and
	   hide in a peaceful, mobs will also push you multiple rooms till
           you are in a non-peaceful room.

03-02-02 : We're on postgresql now.  Enjoy.  Hope it works.

03-01-02 : ATTENTION - IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: Over the next few weeks,
	   mobs will be slowly going up in level.  This will do two things,
           it will make them more difficult, and it will make them worth
           more experience.  This is a warning to STAY ON YOUR TOES.  The
           mud is not getting any easier or harder through this change,
           but specific zones may not be as easy or appropriate for the
           same levels they used to be.

02-28-02 : Bounty Hunters have been tweaked a bit.  They will now come more
           frequently, and will be a little bit nicer about asking for loot
           before they attack.  They will also be a bit harder to get away
           from in the event you don't give them what they want.

02-28-02 : Adding a message whenever you tithe talens.  This should clear up
           all of those annoying "I did X and I'm losing money" questions, 
           where X is picking up money, stealing, etc.  If your faction
           has a tithe percent set, you tithe talens automatically.

02-28-02 : Adding a cooking command.  You can't use it though, because there
           is no cookware or recipe books in the game.  Hahaha suckers.

02-28-02 : You can now put containers into other containers, but only if
           they're empty.

02-25-02 : Fixed a bug that has been lurking in the damage code for a
           long time.  Dex was being factored in to damage under special
           circumstances when it should not have been.  The bug has been
           fixed, so you may notice a slight decrease in your combat
           damage, especially if you used pierce weapons.  Sorry for the
           belated news entry.

02-25-02 : Added some stat info to "att cond".

02-22-02 : Converted 'who' to use strings instead of char pounters.  This
           will cut down on our crashes some.  Let me know if you see 
           something funky with 'who'.

02-20-02 : New shaman healing disc with a new skill 'healing grasp'.

02-20-02 : Major slip up fixed. When I added mage scribe to the game I 
	   never set the learning rate and start to what it was intended.
	   This is fixed so you may want to check your skill level and
	   re-evaluate the worth of the skill. The rate that was set was 
	   intended as a testing level. (so I could see increases etc.)

02-13-02 : Modified some prompt stuff, so all your prompt configurations
           are probably corrupt.  Hopefully I converted the pfiles right,
           so that the prompts are the only things corrupted.  Cross your
           fingers.

02-13-02 : Adjusted the faction score board formulas slightly and added
           a help file "faction score" to explain them.  It might take 
           awhile to get these working well.

02-10-02 : Due to repeated attacks, the city of Brightmoon has begun
	   training paladins into archers and crossbowmen to man their walls.
	   Logrites beware, for they are proven to be rather excitable.

02-10-02 : Earthmaw, Sky Spirit, and Feral Wrath ranger skills have
	   been implemented.

02-08-02 : Ok you freaking whiners, consider now gives a special message when
           you've never fought the mob before.

02-06-02 : There is a new faction scoreboard in the Kindred Pub.  More
           scoring components will be added when it becomes feasible.
           Player files are NOT stored in the database, so it is difficult
           to use statistics based on player wealth etc.

02-05-02 : Consider will now say that you will gain full experience
           for mobs that you have never fought, whereas previously
           it would simply omit that line until you had attacked them.

02-05-02 : Added a Logrus faction board, somewhere in Logrus.

02-04-02 : Re-wrote the database interface and converted a bunch of the
           code to use it.  If you see anything wacked out, let me know.

02-02-02 : Opps forgot to mention that eyes of fertuman is now somewhat
           limited in the items that it can detect.

01-31-02 : The shop change mentioned on the board is now in place.  When
           selling a shop, you no longer receive money for the shops 
           inventory.

01-29-02 : There is a new informational board in the GH Casino.

01-20-02 : Added a new thief skill to the murder disc. Throat slitting is
	   an opening move that could be considered an advanced opening
	   combat maneuver. Help SLIT for details.

01-20-02 : The permadeath monument has been a little wacky lately, putting
           names on for people that aren't permadeath etc.  I think I got
           the bug fixed.

01-17-02 : Added a shop just north and east of GH that sells seeds to
           various plants.  You can use the "plant" command to plant them.

01-12-02 : Fixed a small bug with the permadeath monument.  Note that
           if you delete a dead permadeath and remake, you will lose your
           spot on the monument as soon as you gain to second level.

01-10-02 : There is a new informational board in the lobby of the GH Bank.

01-10-02 : Added a couple of bells and whistles to butcher.

01-10-02 : There is a new informational board in the GH Morgue.

01-07-02 : "help multiplaying" updated.

01-04-02 : AC is now dynamically generated.  What does this mean to you?
           Nothing really, but if really really really think your AC or 
           a mobs AC is wacked out, please tell Peel.

01-03-02 : Peel now has a miniature idol that you can whittle.
           Happy now Frobozz?
