<P>
The on-line help files are considered "basic knowledge" and they do contain
some other rules, caveats, warnings and the like.  They are also cross-
referenced and indexed.  Type <A HREF="../help/index.html">HELP</A> to get the basic help menu which lists
the relevant sub-indexes.  Alternatively, you can jump right to the file
you want if you do HELP (command/file name).  It is a good idea to read the
help file on any command before you use it, even innocuous sounding commands
_might_ have something strange about them that you are expected to know about.
<P>
Major changes and code updates are detailed in the <A HREF="../online/news">NEWS</A> (type: NEWS).  NEWS
always supersedes help files, although the help files eventually get updated
with the changes from news.
<P>
See chapter <A HREF="newbie4.html">4</A> for more info on NEWS.
