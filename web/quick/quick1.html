<P>The main differences between SneezyMUD 4.1 and
SneezyMUD 5.0 are in the race system, stat system, skill learning and discipline systems.  In
addition, there have been changes to how some of the skills work, mage
damage, faction code, how lag applies to casters, and the other numerous changes listed in help files and in news.  Last, there have been upgrades to utility functions like color, auto, score
and attribute. Combat formulas are still upgrading so some of the changes are still in
formulation including eliminating the tie-ins between damage and weapon weights and making weapon skill more important than the weapon itself. The world has been altered so as to be fully mappable. Towns and other zones have been pushed further apart by more roads, creating more room for growth and a greater feeling of distance.</P>

<P>Rent
is back in the MUD and factions will be implemented in full this version.  Experience tables have been changed to allow the low levels to pass more easily and force players to work harder for higher levels; all classes now have the same table. The experience for 50th level has been changed to 100 million experience.  Azruzi have been
cancelled, monks have been vastly altered an improved, and rangers have been fleshed out and are far more complete. The shaman class will be added some time after opening, replacing some of the role of clerics (in relation to charmies and undead control), using druidic ranger spells, while also introducing new skills such as draining spells.  Some of
the classes are being made to integrate more in groups than in past versions and there is an
impetus to getting more warriors of various races. Multiclassing is no longer an option, and we are attempting to create more hybrid classes such as the deikhan to fill in the gaps.</P>

<P>Most of the changes you will notice
because they are obvious or because they are in the help files.  The rest of this document will be
devoted to general overview, presenting the rationales and reasons behind some of the new
systems and answering some of the frequently asked questions about how and why we did things
the way we did it.  Please understand that a lot has changed.  You may or may not like new
structures but all of them were designed to try to adjust flaws or inconsistencies in
past versions, to generally upgrade the MUD, and to respond to player raised complaints,
wishes and gripes.  It is a given that we will not please everyone with these changes and we will
have new complaints, wishes and gripes and will find things we wished we had implemented with this version as well.</P>
