Character Statistics
<HR WIDTH=40% ALIGN=LEFT>
SneezyMUD distinguishes between a player's NATURAL and their ADJUSTED stats.
Natural stats are those stats set by you at the outset of character 
development.  Natural stats have a slight fluctuation based on the age of
the character.  Adjusted stats are what the person's actual ability is
after being modified for magical affects.  The most important difference
between adjusted and natural stats is that events with a long-term effect
(such as gaining) rely strictly on the natural stat, while short-term effects
(skills, spells) will reference the adjusted stat.
