(tasked regeneration)
<P>
On SneezyMUD, the actions of sitting, resting or sleeping are handled as
tasks for purposes of increasing the regeneration rates.  The tick-time
regeneration rate is independent of position (ie, you get a flat amount
at tick time).  However, if you rest for a set amount of time, then you
are awarded 1 point of mana/move and hp.  The time between these regenerative
pulses is different for the various positions.  Sleeping will restore you
very quickly, while sitting is less slow.
<P>
This method was instituted as one of the favorite tricks of clients is to
keep track of when the regenerative pulses would occur.  If they could be
sleeping at exactly the right second, it would treat them as if they had
been sleeping for the entire tick.  Under tasked regeneration rules, this
trick no longer exists.  Plus, it means you need not rest the entire tick
if all you need is 1 or 2 hit points.
