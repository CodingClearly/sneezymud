Confirmed bugs/features:
- Charming a mob removes it's spec-proc
- If your elemental tank is resuced by another you, if you are casting, becomes
  the tank.
- Flying mobs fall over and refly the same or next round, no lag.
- Fleeing from charmies bypass the 'do I hate my master' check.
- Charge task needs to trigger the final, actual, 'charge' faster.
- OED applies don't list Discipline applies properly in-editor.
- knit-bone/cure-para/ect... needs to un-flag mobiles for the torment code.
- Fireball wands are no longer valid due to the restrictions.


Uncofirmed(but reviewed) Bug Reports:
- Plauge of locusts doing little/no damage.
- Plauge of locusts not even working anymore.
- Frost Giant reported as failing his bash on the Frontier gate constantly.
- stomp not caught in the "death by skilllag reduction" thing
- Reports of massive 'light loss' when a lantern burns out or a moblie picks up the lantern.
- Reports of making traps not working, always blowing up.
- Prince S'Sshir keeps vanishing when he's attacked and the aggressor flees.
- Make sure Chi initates combat even if attempt failed.
- Getting charmed by a siren then the siren dying doesn't remove the charm flag
- Invis un-inivising occuring after every spell cast.
- Getting your stuff repossessed by linkloss sometimes doesn't remove you
  talens proper.  Puts 1 set in the bag and hands the other set to you on login
- Some mobs not developing hatreds upon being attacked.
- Claims that being rescued negates fly status.


Bugged Ideas:
- Please display the "you can't increase that duration " messages on any
  attempt, be it failed, succed or whatnot... Suck to repeatedly faila
  skill...then when you final succeed... ' find out you were wasting your
  time anyways. 
- Think of something smarter than 'shatters' for bow destruction.
- Allow people to call their pets from adjacent rooms.
- Allow 'open <container> yes' to allow bypassing of detect trap.


Confirmed/Unconfirmed Other:
- movement needs a real big overhaul.  rawMove() and displayOne() are flakey
  because rawMove shows the move to yourself and puts you in new room,
  while display shows it to everyone else.
- Should be able to order 'flee' to use a portal and perhaps even have it
  default to possibly using one without a direction given.

Subject: Tiny Horn of Ganthi
I've died twice and both times my weapon wasn't on my corpse.  However it did appear in the shop at brand new.  I didn't check shop before I died, but I think it's odd that it happened.  Weapon = a Tiny horn of Ganthi.  Anyway look into it I don't wanna h

ave to pay 13k everytime I die to rebuy a weapon. Just a hunch but if it happens again I'll make sure someone knows about it.  -Lancelot

When true sighted and using eyes players with lots of shadowy will show up as someone.  Eyes still does a crappy job at finding anything, how about it listing a pageful of finds everytime instead of casting it 5 times just to see a piece of equipment you'

  I was berserking when fightring a second story man when the SneezyMUD client crashes.  When I log back in, all my eq is taken by the linkloss abuse code.  The second incident:  I was berserking while fighting an elite-cityguard.  Once again the client c

Subject: [Bug] Lay Hands
Per the helpfile : Laying on of hands may only be done once per 12 hours. Per my score after using it : Affected : 'lay hands'  : Approx. Duration : 1 day, 7 hours, 2 minutes  These don't exactly add up, I spent my practices learning this skill because it
 looked like a good form of healing that I could use every 12 hours or so, instead I find out that the helpfile is off by about triple the hours. Please fix the helpfile or lower the duration before being able to lay hands.
