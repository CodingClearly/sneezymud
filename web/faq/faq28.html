This question is commonly asked by players after they view their stats with the
<A HREF="../help/attribute">ATTRIBUTE</A> command.  The short answer to this question is that they are.  The
real answer is that the stats you set initially are used as a baseline.  
However, a slight variation from this baseline is implemented based on the
player's age.  For instance, a younger PC will have increased strength and
karma, but lower intelligence and wisdom, while more elderly PC's essentially
have the reverse of this.
