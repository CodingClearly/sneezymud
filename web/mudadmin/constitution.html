<p>
<big><strong>
I. The Partnership
</big></strong>
<p><p>
1.) The partnership of the MUD is: Russ Russell (Brutius), Jeff Bennett (Batopr), Ben Sarnoff (Cosmo) and Travis Nelson (Peel).
<p>
2.) The partnership shall be charged with deciding upon what other current members of the MUD (if any) should also become partners.
<p>
3.) New partners shall only be added by unanimous approval of the
current partners.  Partnership is only conferred upon signing of any
contractual agreements.
<p>
4.) "Code access" rights may be revoked by unanimous approval of
the partners.  No partner may be denied "code access".
<p>
5.) Any resolution changing the requirements for admission to
partnership or the requirements for "code access" must be approved by 4/5
of the MudAdmin and 2/3 of the current partners.
<p>
6.) Each partner will have a single Mudadmin vote which
they may cast.
<p>
7.) Partners will not be considered members of Mudadmin
for the purposes of quorum only.
<p><p>
<big><strong>
II. MudAdmin Board
</big></strong>
<p><p>
1.) The MudAdmin shall consist of all office holders in any of the
following positions: Coder, LOW, Junior LOW, Quest Manager, Site Provider, Webmaster, Treasurer or System Administrator.
<p>
2.) The title of "Wizard" on the mud shall be reserved solely for
titled positions of Mudadmin. The title of "God" shall be reserved
solely for all other positions on Mudadmin. All other immortals shall
have the title of "Builder".
<p>
3.) Retirement or removal as a MudAdmin office holder will constitute
removal from the MudAdmin as well, if no other MudAdmin positions are
held by that member.
<p>
4.) People other than office holders may be added to the MudAdmin by
2/3 vote of the MudAdmin.
<p>
5.) Any person sitting on the MudAdmin, not holding one of the
positions granted a seat on the MudAdmin may be removed from the MudAdmin by
majority vote.
<p><p>
<big><strong>
III. MudAdmin Voting
</big></strong>
<p><p>
1.) All members of the MudAdmin board have a single vote which they
may cast.
<p>
2.) Only the chairman of the board may actually call a vote.  The
chair may put before the board a vote on any issue the chair sees fit.
Additionally, members of the board may request the chairman call a vote
on a resolution, and it falls upon the chairman to accept this request and
put a vote before the board, or to decline to vote on the requested
resolution.  If the
chairman declines to call a vote on a resolution, a member of the board may
draft a resolution, and upon it being seconded by another member of the board,
a vote on that resolution is called.
<p>
3.) All votes of the MudAdmin are to be submitted, responded to and discussed via the SneezyMUD Forums. In the event the SneezyMUD Forums are unavailable, votes may be submitted, responded to and discussed over email. 
<p>
4.) A vote is initiated when a proposed resolution meets the criteria
for a vote to be called, a resolution is drafted, and the resolution
is submitted for discussion.
<p>
5.) All members of MudAdmin will be informed when resolutions are
submitted for official discussion via email. The discussion period
extends for 24 hours after the resolution is officially submitted to
the forums. A majority 'show of hands' of MudAdmin may allow the
discussion period to be skipped.
<p>
6.) Only the author of a proposed resolution may withdraw the
resolution in question, up until the conclusion of the official
discussion. In case the resolution is resubmitted with modifications,
it must still meet the criteria for a vote to be called, and the
official discussion period will restart.
<p>
7.) At the conclusion of the official discussion period, the vote on
the proposed resolution is called. All members of MudAdmin will be
informed via email when voting on a resolution begins. The voting
period extends for 24 hours after the resolution is submitted to all
members.
<p>
8.) If a vote fails to receive the necessary quorum of votes to consider
it valid within the 24 hour period, it may still be considered valid
if votes are received from all members within a reasonable duration of time.
The chairman will be required to inform the board when the 24 hour period
has passed, and that the vote is being extended in this manner.
<p>
9.) A previous resolution that received a quorum of votes may only be
reviewed again by initiation of the Chairman. Alternately, a majority
vote of MudAdmin may called to reopen the dead issue. In such a case,
a vote must be called to reopen the dead issue, and only if it passes
will new resolutions on that issue be allowed.
<p>
10.) A vote of the MudAdmin board is only considered valid if 3/4 of
the current members cast a vote.  Any vote where fewer than 3/4 of the current
members vote may not be considered valid.
<p>
11.) All votes of the MudAdmin, except those specifically noted,
are assumed to be decided by majority decision of those people casting votes.
A vote may only be considered decided if enough votes to establish quorum
exist.
<p>
12.) Any resolution that raises the voting requirement to something
other than majority rule may only be amended by a vote of the MudAdmin at the
voting requirement of the resolution being changed.
<p>
13.) A member of the MudAdmin is expected to recuse themselves from
voting on any issue that presents itself as a conflict of interest for
that member to be voting upon.  A vote of recusal shall neither count
for nor against when determining if a particular resolution passes.
<p><p>
<big><strong>
IV. MudAdmin Powers
</big></strong>
<p><p>
1.) It shall require a 2/3 vote of the MudAdmin to perform a global
player or rent wipe.
<p>
2.) It shall require a 2/3 vote of the MudAdmin to take the mud
into a beta period of development.
<p>
3.) It shall require a 2/3 vote of the MudAdmin to take the mud
out of a beta period of development.
<p>
4.) With the exception of a wizlock situation, it shall require a
2/3 vote of the MudAdmin to make the mud inaccessible to the player base.
<p>
5.) The MudAdmin, by 2/3 vote, may vote to remove a builder or god should the
LOW not do so.
<p>
6.) It shall require a 2/3 vote of Mudadmin to grant access to the
file system on which the MUD resides (called "code access").  Newly
appointed members to the positions of Coder and LOW will automatically
be granted access.
<p><p>
<big><strong>
V. Chairman of MudAdmin
</big></strong>
<p><p>
1.) The MudAdmin board will be chaired by a single member.  The
chairman is solely responsible for calling for votes of the MudAdmin board,
recording those votes, and informing those interested of the outcomes of those
votes.  This position will be referred to as the chairman.
<p>
2.) The Chairman of the MudAdmin board must be a current voting
member of the MudAdmin board, and shall be appointed by majority vote of the
board.
<p>
3.) The chairman may be removed by majority vote of the board.
Should a new chairman be elected by majority vote, the current chairman is
removed as office holder, but retains their position on the MudAdmin board.
<p><p>
<big><strong>
VI. MudAdmin Reports
</big></strong>
<p><p>
1.) Members of the MudAdmin shall make their contact numbers
available to the other members of the MudAdmin in order to facilitate
resolving disagreements quicker and with less emotional overtones.
<p>
2.) All resolutions of the MudAdmin that are adopted will be made
available to the public.
<p>
3.) Those resolutions of the MudAdmin that fail to pass, or that
were proposed but failed to obtain quorum will be made available to the
public (with appropriate notation to indicate that they were not adopted).
<p>
4.) Votes of the MudAdmin made to the public shall only
acknowledge that the resolution passed or failed, and not record what members
may or may not have voted for or against the resolution.

<p><p>
<big><strong>
VII. Immortal Hierarchy
</big></strong>
<p><p>

1.) All immortals shall be classified as either a builder, a god, or
a member of the Board of MudAdmin.
<p>
2.) The LOW (or the LOW Staff if so designated) shall oversee all immortals
classified as builders.
<p>
3.) All new immortals will be classified as builders initially.
<p>
4.) The LOW (or the LOW Staff if so designated) may unilaterally remove
any builder for abscence, negligence, malfeasance, or otherwise abusing the
powers of their office.  In such an event, notification of the MudAdmin
is expected.  The builder in question may appeal this action to the MudAdmin
if they so choose.
<p>
5.) It shall require a 3/5 vote of MudAdmin to change the criteria for which
the LOW may unilaterally remove a builder.
<p>
6.) A builder may only become a god by the agreement of the LOW (or
the LOW Staff if so designated).
<p><p>
<big><strong>
VIII. Direction of the MUD
</big></strong>
<p><p>
1.) The abstract of the v5.1 mud shall read:
<br>
<i>
v5.1 will be focused on reintroducing concepts that worked in prior versions
but that were removed in favor of code that is now viewed as problematic.
v5.1 will NOT introduce radical new concepts that have yet to be tried.  v5.1's
main intent is to provide a stable, feature-rich, enjoyable code base in a
minimal amount of time.
</i>
<p>
2.) The concept of "levels" for immortals shall be removed.  Immortal
powers shall be assigned to individuals on a case by case basis.  The
mechanism for this shall be left to the coders as an implementation detail.
A given power may be conferred or revoked by any member of the MudAdmin.
If a power is revoked, notification of the MudAdmin is expected.
<p>
3.) It shall be our policy to offer as much depth and detail as
is feasible given our technical constraints in terms of what is
textually presented to users of the mud.
<p>
4.) Textual descriptions may deviate from the accepted policy delving
into "less decent" aspects of life, provided that it makes reasonable
sense to do so, provided that innocent bystanders are shielded, and
provided that an appropriate filtering process is devised to warn anyone
that might be insulted or offended to steer clear.  At no time shall
such an aspect be developed as a required event for a player, and should
only be developed for fleshing out a detail that makes legitimate sense.
<p>
5.) At no time should the textual description of anything be vulgar for
the sake of being vulgar.  It is permissible to be exceptionally graphic
in describing something, but there is a fine line between worthwhile
description and senseless vulgarity.
<p>
6.) It shall be the responsibility of the respective position head (LOW,
coder or quest manager) to enforce the appropriate standards in their
respective areas.  It shall not be appropriate for those people to act as
censors, but it is permissible for them to ask for objectionable aspects
to be rewritten so as to comply with the standards.
<p>
7.) The position heads
may refuse to add a sub-par element unless it gets rewritten, but are
specifically not entitled to remove an element that has been activated in
the past.  In this latter case, they are free to have the element rewritten,
but can not remove the element pending that rewrite.
<p><p>
<big><strong>
IX. Funding of the MUD
</big></strong>
<p><p>
1.) The MUD Treasurer will hold possession all cash funds and be required to report on the status and amount of all approved funds, cash or otherwise. Additionally, the Treasurer will record all fund transactions permanently on the MUD server.
<p>
2.) Any cash, item or paid service transaction that may concern the MUD will be considered a funding transaction. This includes, but is not limited to, transactions that have not been sanctioned by MudAdmin.
<p>
3.) Any expenditure or addition of funding by the MUD or MudAdmin must first be approved by a majority vote of MudAdmin. This includes, but is not limited to, any exchange of items or paid services and any expenditure of cash reserves. Accepting non-compensated cash donations does not require MudAdmin approval.
<p>
4.) Any unapproved addition of funding to the MUD (such as paid advertising, cash donations in exchange for unapproved benefits, etc) will not be sanctioned or acknowledged by MudAdmin. Such transactions will be returned or cancelled, where possible.
<p>
5.) Any benefit to be provided by MudAdmin in exchange for a fund transaction must first be approved by a majority vote of MudAdmin. Benefits may not include partial ownership of the MUD or of MUD resources.
<p>
6.) Any member of MudAdmin may personally make a temporary loan to the MUD treasury in order to keep the MUD running, subject to approval by a majority vote of MudAdmin. In an emergency situation where a MudAdmin vote may not be called, automatic approval is granted.
<p>
7.) No expenditure of the MUD treasury will be allowed until all personal loans to the MUD are paid off.
