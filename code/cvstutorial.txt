Do 'cvs update' periodically to keep your dev code in sync with the
production code.  This will merge in other coders changes with your
dev code.  You should try and do this pretty frequently.

---

When you are ready to move your changes into production, do 'cvs
commit'.  Also leave a comment about your code changes.  Try to be
somewhat detailed.
"Fixed bug." => bad
"Fixed bug in doSomething()" => better
"Fixed buffer overflow on name variable in doSomething()" => good

---

If you fucked up a file and want to discard your version, simply
remove it and do 'cvs update' to checkout the production version.

---

To compile your own dev code:
rm file.mak ; make >& file.mak &

To boot your dev mud:
./sneezy.2 6969 >& file &

I'll probably update bmake and alboot to work with the dev
environments, right now you have to do it manually.  You may have to
use another port if 6969 is being used.

---

To do a code move:
cd /mud/code
cvs update
./bmake.csh
./mvcode.csh

---

Do not ever edit the code in /mud/code.  It is only a snapshot of the
production code, for compiling.

---

The lib directory is linked to /mud/code/lib.  You don't have your own
copy of lib, so be aware that cvs doesn't have any affect on those
files EXCEPT for /mud/code/lib/zonefiles.

---

The zonefiles in /mud/code/lib/zonefiles are in CVS.  If you make
changes to those files you must do a cvs commit from that directory to
check in your changes.  The mvlow script automatically handles the
transfer to prod, after your changes are checked into CVS.

---

CVS has many other options and abilities.  Try 'cvs help' for more
details.  Also: http://cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs.html
