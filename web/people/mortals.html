      Bio huh, you all suck for making me do this I hope you know. So, me huh, lesse I was born a poor black child, no wait, that was
      Steve Martin in the Jerk.  I'm old, dig mudding and quake, ornery not very informed on game stuff. I get into way to much trouble
      not a really safe person to have in a group if everyone wants to live long and not take chances.  You know it's time to run if you
      hear me say either " I THINK we can do this..." OR " I have a plan".
      Anywho, ya wanna know something about me ask me and I might even answer ya's if not nothing personal. Oh yeah, my real life name is
      Jay Harrington and my chars are primarily Anvil or Kedryn.<br>

      <p align="left"><b>Calix/Barter/Wicca/Pagan</b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>Calix</b> is a wandering thief who joined the Logrus
      out of a desire for revenge against Galeks fellowship. Long ago he lived
      in a so called 'pagan village' (read did not follow Galek) and went out
      one day to gather materials for his parents. When he came back he found
      that his home had been made an 'object lesson' and his parents nailed to
      it's outside walls for all to see, then burned.&nbsp; Now all he lives for
      is revenge and has one regret, that the Galek clerics don't repop<br>
      faster...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Barter</b> is a mage who is trying to find 'the ultimate link between
      mages and clerics' powers. Needless to say Galeks clerics don't like this
      idea one bit and occasionally try and hunt him down as a herectic, he's
      been known to send elementals running through Galeks chruch for fun when
      the fancy strikes him or after he's just dodged an attempt on his life.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Wicca</b> is a simple gnome cleric who joined logrus because he was
      kicked out of the Galek brotherhood when he said other factions had some
      pretty sensible ideas at times.&nbsp; He finds it truely ironic that he
      still has to report to the Galekian pope for new skills at times.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pagan</b> is the brother of Calix and roams the earth preparing to take
      the battle to Galek, all he needs is for Calix or one of his friends to
      hit level 50 so he can multi class...<br>

      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I’ve been playing SneezyMUD since December 1998.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Blame Damian/Elon for introducing me to the MUD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I was hooked the first time I played.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I’m a relative newbie compared to a lot of the players here, but
      most of them seem to have accepted me pretty well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>My current playing goal is to hit L50 at least once in every class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>When I first stated this goal, I was laughed at and told it would
      take me years to do it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In a
      little over a year and a half, I’ve managed to hit L50 in 5 of the 7
      available classes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I’m
      going to provide some brief information on my L50’s.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Claw</b>, L50 Ogre Warrior<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Claw was my first character on Sneezy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He had 37 glorious deaths before he finally made it to L50.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>One of those occurred when Bryant typed ‘kill blob’ and
      attacked Claw instead of Nivek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He also was a victim of the infamous “Day of the Sandworm” in
      which he was swallowed twice by that particularly nasty mob.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Claw was the character with which I met many of the current
      players on the MUD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      frequently grouped with Darsant, Cern, Bryant and Spineless.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He also is a former Guardian of the Step which is a position
      of import within the Brotherhood of Galek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Claw occasionally comes out of the inn to socialize with other
      players or to even play.<o:p>

      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Killjoy</b>, L50 Elf Cleric<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Killjoy was my first elf character and I have been
      hooked on that particular race since.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Killjoy is not the typical hang around and heal the tank cleric.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Killjoy has tanked several tough mobs due to the fact he is
      able to wear dwarven-sized armor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Killjoy
      also was the character that first taught me the value of grouping to gain
      experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As Killjoy, I met
      Iradel who is one of my best friends on the MUD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Killjoy was also there to help Iradel make it to L50 which brought
      me as much satisfaction as getting any of my on pc’s to that level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Killjoy comes out of the inn occasionally when someone needs a
      little high level cleric help.<o:p>

      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Leromir</b>, L50 Elf Monk<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Leromir may well be the best character I’ve made on
      Sneezy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A lot of thanks goes
      to Drizzt who gave me advice on making an elf monk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Leromir made the trip to L50 quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Lero is approaching 50 crushed skulls in his career.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Lero also comes out of the inn on occasion when other high levels
      are on and need a monk hitter/tank.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kendon</b>, L50 Human Deikhan<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Kendon, for a long time, was just a throw away
      character that was sitting in my pfile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I never really played him seriously until Leromir hit L50.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Kendon is, like most deikhans, a strong tank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He has completed all 3 deikhan sword quests and currently possesses
      his Holy Devastator and Deikhan’s Shield of Truth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Kendon comes out of the inn usually to practice smite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>However, he is ready whenever a group wants a tank to take down a
      particularly tough mob.<o:p>

      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Darkwind is the character you’re most likely to see
      on the MUD at any given time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      is currently a leader within the Order of The Serpents faction and is
      usually around in that capacity to help current Serpents and to recruit
      new ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Darky has spent a
      lot of time grouping with Enchantress aiding her in her quest to hit L50
      which she succeeded in doing. Darkwind is also the character that I do the
      heaviest role-playing with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
      such, he has much more of a story than my other pc’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>That story should eventually be available when The Order of the
      Serpents gets its on page on the Sneezy site.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Enchantress</b><br>
      <br>
      Ever since I could remember, I was surrounded by a forest of trees and a
      family who loved me. We lived surprisingly in a mixed race village. A
      small community of hobbits, elves, humans, and we even had some civilized
      ogres living at our outskirts. From burrows to huts we seemed to get along
      peacefully. As I was growing up, I learned many things from my family and
      fellow citizens.<br>
      <br>
      The ogres I actually got along with, and they use to throw me up on their
      shoulders and go crashing through the forest. They taught me strength and
      courage. (It's hard not to be brave when you have a humongous ogre
      spinning you around with one hand.) Sommerdai, who helped introduce me to
      these lands, was one of my greatest friends, I think I got my temper from
      her. The elves helped me to practice relaxation and meditation, when I was
      older we even dabbled a bit in the ways of magic. My family never forbid
      magical ways, just never promoted it. As such I have not done much in the
      ways of the mystical arts, though when I was young I could make a candle
      light by staring at it.<br>
      <br>
      As I was growing up the hobbits became one of my biggest influences. Quick
      on speed and dexterity it was amazing what they could do. As kids we use
      to do sleight-of-hand magic tricks for the rest of the village for coins.
      As I grew older the hobbits taught me life long skills. How to find what I
      needed and pilfer what I couldn't afford. Their art of talk and persuasion
      was none like I've ever seen. They could make you believe just about
      anything if you listened to them long enough.<br>
      <br>
      My family.....I loved my family very much. What I didn't learn from our
      villagers I learned from my family. I never took one minute for granted
      with them. They taught me independence, confidence, patience, and how to
      survive. My parents taught me trust, loyalty, and responsibility. They put
      their faith in me and taught me I could do anything I set my mind to.
      Above all else, they loved me and showed me that I was a strong, loving
      person who deserved to be treated as such.<br>
      <br>
      Where did the name Enchantress come from? Well it certainly wasn't my real
      name. No I was born as....well, that name is known only to those who truly
      know me and whom I truly trust. However, it might have been the ogres who
      first called me Enchantress when they saw how flowers bloomed suddenly
      around me. Or was it the elves who first nicknamed me Enchantress when I
      first started practicing spells with them? Or it might have been the
      hobbits who saw how quickly I picked up their various arts of persuasion.
      In any case, I've been called Enchantress for as long as I can remember,
      so it's what I go by to this day.<br>
      <br>
      When I turned eighteen, as was my right, I decided to leave our village
      and find a place of my own. I do go back to visit the village often, but
      this land is where I currently make my home.<br>

      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1634, his village was under attack by the
      emperor's soldiers. The villagers and his family fled for their lives, young Heish was abandoned
      in the middle of the battlefield. Heishiro's mother came rushing for him, from
      the east an army of men with firearms barrage the area with bullets. Him and
      his mother were caught in the line of fire, and she used her own body to
      shield young Heish. Heishiro's life paused as he watched his mother murdered in
      front of him. With the lifeless body of his mother covering him, Emiko smiled and
      said, 'Be strong my beloved son.' touching his cheek. Heishiro's tears ran dry
      as a silent cried of pain struck his heart.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 hours later, all the emperor's soldier had left
      the village. Buried under his mother's corpse with a shattered heart, he begins the scan the
      area; that which he had called home is now known as a cemetery. Heishiro began
      to make a decent burial ground for his mother and the villagers. Crying beside his
      mother's gravestone, a mysterious man with a large red mantle saw a young boy sitting beside a gravestone as he journey towards the burnt down
      village.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heishiro notice a large figure is approaching the
      village. The mysterious man looked at the child and smiled. Heish picks up a broken katana as
      he charged towards him with a fierce force. He smirks and with lightning reflexes.
      quickly draws his hidden katana deflecting Heishiro's<br>
      attack. Seijiro smirks, 'Your attack was sloppy I could have easily killed you.
      It seem you got a good potienal of being a skillful swordsmen.'<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is when Heishiro begans his life of a
      swordsmen, as Seijiro as his guide. Seijiro took Heishiro as his own child and begin to teach him the
      art of a swordsmen. Seijiro developed an strange illness and told Heishiro
      he's not going to be here long. He gave Heishiro a map, a boat, and some money.
      Seijiro pats heishiro's head, 'Head to Grimhaven. There is where you can<br>
      find your true self'', he coughs.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The journey continues as Heishiro set
      sail to Grimhaven...<br>

      <p>&quot;<b>Tannith</b>, son of Thark, son of ScavengerThor, son of
      Thorace, son of Thorice the almost terrible...<br>
      <br>
      Coming from a short line of warriors (with a monk or two mixed in),
      Tannith is known for dying and otherwise causing trouble...<br>
      <br>
      His favorite pastime is catching leprosy, then begging Sneezy's cleric
      population for a cure...<br>
      <br>
      Also likes to pick on all mobs associated the Grimhaven city guard...<br>
      <br>
      Thinks that hobbits are good... with BBQ sauce...<br>
      <br>
      ... and if you ask him nicely he'll go a bunch of talens with no strings
      attached.&quot;<br>

          Description:&nbsp;</b> Leader of the Elite Wyvernriders as
          well as the Templar Guard.&nbsp; Inside the heart of this grizzled old
          warrior still burns the flame of passion--passion for
          destruction--destruction of the weak.&nbsp; His steely green eyes
          shine with youth like twin suns.&nbsp; Yet with his body failing, the
          old warrior is waiting.&nbsp; Waiting for the next great one, the next
          chosen, the next Lord Templar. Yet in the
          meanwhile, his heart is still cold, his eyes still menacing, his blade
          ever sharp, his enemies...corpses cooling in the field.

      was born in the year of the Prophets 620 in the lands known as the
      Frontier. My Father Lancen was a just and true man who taught me much in
      the way of the Knighthood and of my ancestry. Jedin my older brother used
      to tell me of his adventures in the Knighthood while we played amidst the
      forests of Mount Kolvir, and hunted beasts for food. It was there I was
      called by Jevon to collect the records of my forefathers contained within
      the catacombs of the Brightmoon Cathedral. The mighty Elyon in turn called
      upon me to restore the fallen Order of Galek to its true beauty and
      fullness of purpose.<o:p>
