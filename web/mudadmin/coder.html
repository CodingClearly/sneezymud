<big><strong>
Abstract:
</big></strong>
<br>
Utilizes C++ and UNIX skills to maintain all code files and other assorted
resources for the mud.

<p>
<big><strong>
Priorities:
</big></strong>
<br>
1.) Maintain high uptimes, by repairing crash bugs.
<br>
2.) Fixes any cheat bugs that circumvent intent of gaming system.
<br>
3.) Respond to player's questions about gaming system in non-technical terms.
    Keep players informed of coder's daily activities.
<br>
4.) Remove any item from bug/idea/typo list known to be inaccurate or fixed.
<br>
5.) Fixes any bugs that detract from player's overall enjoyment.
<br>
6.) Fix bugs causing gaming system to misoperate.
<br>
7.) Implement enhancements needed by LOWs and Builders.
<br>
8.) Repair typos and other trivial fixes.
<br>
9.) Implement any simple enhancements that do not significantly alter gaming
    system.
<br>
10.) Implement any significant change to gaming system according to constraints
    of MudAdmin's approval.

<p>

<big><strong>
Expectations:
</big></strong>
<br>
A coder is awarded a high ranking position, and is given great autonomy over
changes, and as such, has high expectations by the mudding community.
<br>
1.) Coders must be reasonably available.
<ul>
      - A coder is expected to provide, at minimum, 10 hours a week of
        programming to maintain good status.
<br>
      - Coders consistently unable to provide the minimum programming
        requirement will be asked to step down until their situation changes.
<br>
      - Expected abscences of 3+ days should be reported to the MudAdmin
        via email.
<br>
      - Inability to perform regular duties, or things happening in RL that
        may impact online activities, should also be reported to avoid
        scheduling problems.
</ul>
2.) Coders should not overcommit themselves to projects.
<br>
3.) Coders are expected to follow the coding standards as agreed to by all
    coders in terms of programming style and format issues.
<br>
4.) Coders are expected to leave the development environment in a state where
    others are able to work, or provide an explanation to the other coders
    and estimate the time until normal coding activities will be possible.
<br>
5.) Coders are expected to fix trivial problems in other people's current
    projects (i.e. simple compiler errors where intentions were obvious).
    Furthermore, coders are expected to not make significant alterations
    (aside from commenting out large sections of non-working code) to other
    coder's projects.  No stepping on toes, but fix the obvious glaring
    problems.
<br>
6.) Coders are expected to maintain backups of the code, the other mud
    resources, and the various player files.

Contact Points:
</big></strong>
<br>
Other Coders : Coders act as a team overall, but by and large work
   independantly on their personal project.

<br><br>
LOW : Coders coordinate with the LOW(s) when implementing projects that
   require changes involving the LOW staff.
   Coders are expected to respect the LOWs authority over the tiny files
   and not make changes therein without proper notification and authorization.

<br><br>
Builders : Coders implement the things requested by builders for completion
   of zones.
   Coders need only provide implementation for reasonable special procedures.
   Requests that are very broad in scope, or challenge aspects of the existing
   gaming system may be deferred.

<br><br>
MudAdmin : Coders receive direction for major changes to gaming system from
   MudAdmin, and provide to them status reports as necessary.
   MudAdmin is expected to identify those areas that are authorized for
   overhaul, but it remains coders authority to volunteer to undertake the
   project(s) that the coder sees fit.  MudAdmin may provide simplistic
   constraints that guide the projects, but should leave specific
   implementation details to the coders.

<br><br>
Immortal Council : The ICon may dictate a change in policy or rules that
   is to be enforced via code.  Coders are expected to work with the ICon to
   provide technical feasibility statements, and to perform the implementation
   of these changes.

<br><br>
Site Provider : Acts as liaison for the mud as a whole to the site provider,
   keeping the site provider informed of resource usage (and needs).  Makes
   any changes necessary to insure good relations with the site provider.
