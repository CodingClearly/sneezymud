Subject: summary of pyramid adventure
some things noticed after readin the log skeletons in the misty hallways are 
: human, non-undead, and they bleed *gasp*  bashin against 5-15lvl mobs above 
is nearly impossible flying mobs (Ahmed the demon) can crashed to the ground 
and still remain flying
sidenote: noticed demon mobs do incredible limb damage, everyone who tanked 
demon took a beating  one thing i found interestin was, monk deflect thrashes,
Sunburst roar into a blazin flame sorching a monk seems that fire proc hits 
even if the weapon was deflected/dodged

Seems to me there is a bit of a problem with this When you flee from a

once again. At lower levels it seems that when using this method of
fighting you cant possibly sneak and reenter in the time it takes a mob
to enter the room you fled into to sneak. There is some success if your
sneak is successful but I also see this happen and receive the "You are
no longer sneaky." message when I get attacked. Maybe this should be

Mobs with contagious diseases should not be allowed to hide out in center square or in a shop(read as no combat room).  The town crier or shop owner should kick them out.  This will allow mobs and pc with a contagious disease to at least pass through a no combat room but not allow them to hang out in one and give the disease to people just passing through.    It's bad enough that invisible leprachauns get leprosy and that there is a day shift and night shift that keep it going.

I've felt for a long time that the zone command should be modified so as to allow the list to be narrowed down by use of either a level range (ex: <zone 15 23> would show zones between lvl 15 and 23) or by using a keyword (ex: <zone mines> would turn up all the zones with the word mines in their name... possibly with mines in any of the room names as well)  Next would be the new disguise target... once a certain level of expertise in the skill is attained, perhaps an alter-ego of sorts could be added to the list... the player would have to go through a quest and then once the ability is attained, the player has to declare the name of the alter-ego (ex: batman).  Not sure what would be done as far as description but something along the lines of "This figure wears a mask" would suffice in my opinion (with a little more imagination added of course :) )  Anyways, those are my ideas... the disguise one could be made as an actual preset target rather than the way I just presented so maybe they could disguise themselves as the tick... I'd like to see it done the other way though myself :)  Therias

Subject: Sitting AFK / Rent Credit / Plevelling
Rent Credit was implemented for a couple of reasons.  1) Help deter low level characters having lots of kick ass eq/weapons that would make them overpowered.  2) Help prevent any level player from any class hoarding stuff,      making eq more available to other players in the game.       A code has also been attached to rent credit that will influence the amount of rent credit a player gets based on the level/playing time of said player.         This code was implemented to take into account the all-popular idea of powerlevelling.  So, if a character gets powerlevelled they don't get full rent credit because they didn't technically "earn it".       This poses a problem.  Currently, the popular thing to do is to get your character  powerlevelled (by yourself or others).  This, of course, adversely effects rent...to help get around the penalty of not getting full rent said powerlevelled character will set up all the necessary triggers and sit AFK for hours and hours at a time in a "safe area", this does 2 things..       1) The player can avoid rent completly and thus have kick ass eq that makes them overpowered.      2) Increases playtime.  This in turn helps the powerlevelled character to go ahead and chip away at the rent credit penalty.       There have been several players who do this and have found themselves mysteriously dead when they go and check up on their character hours and hours later.  Thus "decreasing their enjoyment of their game"....To that I say this, you play a loophole and well, sometimes, you pay...  anyone who gets powerlevelled then sits around a NOHEAL zone to help keep the eq they have been "given"... barely earning ANYTHING for themselves..can't expect all players to be cool with that.    What Id like to see is the following.  1) A code that will automatically disconnects a player who sits    around in the same room for a certain amount of time.  2) A code that prevents the increase in the amount of playtime for a character that sits around in any room for a certain amount of time.  3) A code that will automatically deduct rent from any player who sits  around a room for a certain length of time.  Taking into consideration the fact that people can set up triggers to avoid getting tagged AFK, etc.   I know that these requests are probably huge in terms of code.  And I know that there are certain players who will argue against this because they have to "be available" for faction business or otherwise.  But in  terms for the good of the game anything else would just be encouraging powerlevelling and hoarding which definitely decreases the enjoyment of the overall game.

Subject: Consider skills
As it stands now, you can max know giant without ever fighting a giant.  This just seems kinda wrong.  I think that these skills should improve as you fight the creatures, not as you look at them.  You should still get the same information when you consider the creature, but the skill won't get any better unless you fight a few.  Also the more you know about giants, the better you are at fighting them.  You know there weaknesses and their attack pattern.  This could lead to a bonus in AC, +hit, and +dam when fighting.    This would also make it a bit more fun.  Its kinda boring walking around considering all the goblins in gh to raise know giant.  Instead you can walk around killing them, which is much more fun and rewarding.  It would also lead to more exploring.  For those people who try to max all their skills, you gotta goto many places to max all your "consider" skills.  I would personally like to see somebody with Know veggie maxed.  Well sorry its so long.           Koota

In real life if you get a wire around someones neck they die pretty much instantly because you cut the jugulars. but seeing as that isnt very fair, what if there was only a slim chance of actualy getting it around thie r neck. Maby they could throw thier hand between the garrotte  and the neck and then you could ride thier back for a few rounds untill A, they throw you off, or B they pass out from the force thier own hand is createing on thier neck from the pressure ones garrotte is excerting on it just an idea.

Subject: Paralyze
When a PC is paralyzed they should still be able to initiate spellcasting if they are high enough level.  Paralysis effects the body and not the ability to think.  I do believe that certain spells are able to be cast without spoken mantras/hand gestures.  This idea applies to the initiation of spell casting and not the continuation of spells being cast if a PC becomes paralyzed

Subject: [Idea] Blacksmithing as an Armor/weapon Upgrade path
Just had an idea when thinking about my zone.  I've planned a few multi-part quests, involving a blacksmith for altering an item that was retrieved into a nice piece of armor.  I was thinking that instead of implementing the system specifically for these quests we could have a sort of Blacksmith upgrade system.  You could set certain upgrade paths on weapons based on cost  and/or various item acrruments (talismans, better metals, grip material) and have the blacksmith make a new weapon based on the old.  Not sure how feasible this is, but it would make the  armor/weapon system a little more dynamic.  Could be linked with the new quality system so that a weapon/armor piece could be upgraded to a higher level of quality with enough material and cash.  I wouldn't mind looking into this from a code perspective, or at least talking with one of you imms about it if your interested.  :).. Just give me a ding on builder or 7900 as you see fit.  Glint.

Subject: Why not adjust rent multiplier differently.
It would be cool if the rent multiplier were based individually on the level equipment was intended for as related to your level and the amount of cash you have in the bank.  That way, classes that pay bucks to keep stuff repaired while they tank for others wouldn't get screwed as hard by the multiplier.  Anyhow, just a thought. :)  Bryant.  Old man of the dwarves.

****** Idea from Tahei in room 240 on Fri Jan 26 14:01:33 2001:
Subject: [Idea] New Skill for Deikhans
Well I thought it would be cool for advanced Deikhans to have a skill that Allows then to dive bomb their foes when they are riding a winged mount that is flying. Obviously there would be a few restrictions on this skill, in that your mount must be flying. I think it would be similar to Charge, except that it would probably take you out of the battle for a little longer, both before and after the dive, given time to rise to a sufficient altitude to perform the maneuver. I also think that it would probably do more damage than charge, compensating for the fact that you are out of the battle for that much longer. Note that I think that when you are ascending before the dive, the enemy should not be able to hit you (And of course you should not be able to hit him), but that is up to you guys. Also due to the difficulty in mastering the winged creatures of Grimhaven, is another reason that it should do more damage than charge. I feel this skill is necessary, as most Deikhans get the charge skill very early in the game, and it basically becomes their bread and butter skill This would allow deikhans another interesting skill to use during battles, instead of just spamming charge and then walking away from the keyboard ;) Anyways, regardless of your decision, let me know what you think. Thanks :) Tahei

Plague of locuts should be looked at.  Its one of those spells that doesnt get used at all, especially since one doesn't get exp from the damage it does.  As a result, no on uses it or relies on it in any way. Maybe get rid of it all together if there isn't an intrest in tweaking it in some way.  Maybe a possible fix would be to give the mob a disease or make it so the mob is partially blinded and cannot hit as well instead of doing direct damage(as per help file)
