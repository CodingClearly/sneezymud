      <td width="16%" align="right" valign="top"><b>Cleric&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
      <td width="84%" valign="top">
        Clerics have powerful abilities of healing and transportation.  As with other casting classes, they must decide early on to what extent, if any, they wish to focus on weapon use.  At higher levels they can explore more potent transportation, healing, offensive, and defensive prayers, as well as combat and adventuring disciplines.

    <tr>
      <td width="16%" align="right" valign="top"><b>Deikhan&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
      <td width="84%" valign="top">
        Deikhans have a good mix of combat and healing abilities that make them a very strong class.  They are mounted warriors, and their skill with their mounts gives them powerful attacks and a hefty defensive bonus.  At high levels they can explore a number of disciplines including healing, offensive prayers, and mounted combat.

    <tr>
      <td width="16%" align="right" valign="top"><b>Mage&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
      <td width="84%" valign="top">
        Mages control the magic forces of The World.  As with other casting classes, they must decide early on to what extent, if any, they wish to focus on weapon use.  At high levels they can explore various elemental magics as well as other powerful incantations.

    <tr>
      <td width="16%" align="right" valign="top"><b>Monk&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
      <td width="84%" valign="top">
        Monks are warriors trained in fighting styles that rely on self-reliance and development of one's inner strength.

    <tr>
      <td width="16%" align="right" valign="top"><b>Shaman&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
      <td width="84%" valign="top">
        Shamans are masters of the undead and other natural magics.  Unlike other casters, combat skills are a part of their natural development.  Also unlike other casters, they rely on an ability to channel life force, and can die if they use up their store.

    <tr>
      <td width="16%" align="right" valign="top"><b>Thief&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
      <td width="84%" valign="top">
        Thieves are the unseen robbers and killers of The World.  A very powerful offensive class.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td width="16%" align="right" valign="top"><b>Warrior&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
      <td width="84%" valign="top">
        Warriors are the bread and butter fighters of The World.  They are powerful opponents when well equipped, but can be difficult to play without companions, as their combat styles often require them to absorb a lot of damage, or, at high level, to sacrifice offensive power to make them into defensive monoliths.
