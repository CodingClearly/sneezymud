<P>Moath is played by Dan Robel, a student at Mount Saint Mary's college in Emmitsburg Maryland. Born in April
19, 1979 in quiet Waynesboro, PA, he has been constantly struggling to escape the mundane. When he was finally
introduced to Sneezy 4.1 by his older brother (who often appears on the mud as Gringar the monk), he was hooked.
Having played a mage in various role playing games prior to Sneezy, Moath the mage was an obvious choice for him
to play. Though at first, Moath's corpse was more often seen then Moath himself, under the loving support of his
brother Gringar and many other Sneezy addicts, Moath soon got the hang of being a pure mage on Sneezymud. After
a long series of trials and tribulations, an aged and decrepit Moath was able to claim the title of Archmage, replacing
the immorted Dworkin. Despite his old age, Moath was still able to sling spells with the best of them, and was
often seen going on death-ridden quests. Whether teaching his group the concept of a spell backfire, or aiding
in the defeat of evil hordes, Moath soon became a very involved player. Moath was granted builder status during
the beginning of Sneezymud 4.5 during its beta-testing. Quickly getting involved, Moath was soon building zones,
and helping out with odd jobs, such as making a new issue of the Sneezy Herald. <BR>
Having a great love of building, Moath hopes to one day help develop a subterranean world for Sneezymud, and help
encourage Sneezymud's unique faction system, by including more faction zones. When not busy building or chatting
with everyone on the mud, Moath can often be seen arguing with his brother Gringar, as he is shown new throws and
holds, and learning that quivering palm is not as cute as it sounds.</P>
