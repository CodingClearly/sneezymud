	<DD>Stonecold, &quot;The Enforcer&quot; and King of Typos, has been playing Sneezy since way back when there were
	armies of charmed hobbits. His original creation, Dazzler in 3.0, became famous when, as the only mage in a group
	of adventurers, moments away from attempting to defeat the ice dragon Ky'lish'Ra, he asked which direction she
	was located. He was last heard saying, &quot;do we go &quot; ... the typos then propelled his soon-to-be-lifeless
	body in the correct direction and over a ravine, plunging him down onto the head of a rather pissed off she-dragon.
	<P>Blake, his warrior of 3.1, assisted numerous adventurers and damsels in distress. Racing around the countryside
	with his trusty Axe of the Dwarven Warlords, his shouts often boomed across the plains. &quot;Blake to da rescue!&quot;</P>
	<P>Stonecold was born in the Bronx, New York, and travelled around extensively with $20. He has been working in
	Special Education for six years with severely challenged children at a local high school. He enjoys creating new
	areas and quests, and collaborates on major projects with his wife, <A HREF="rixanne.html">Rixanne.</A> He and
	Rixanne, a coder for Sneezy, live in San Diego, California, with their three cats and three kids. No one's sure
	how he became an immortal, but we think it had to be a typo.</P>
