  The Senior Lord of Worlds is in charge of overseeing the addition,

the scope and direction of growth for the MUD world.  Also the Senior LOW

builders, removing inactive builders or those not work within the set rules
of the building staff, approving new zone ideas and final zone implementation,
working to train and instruct builders to the building styles, and
maintaining appropriate files to indicate what each member of the building
staff is working on and which world related issues need to be addressed.

Coders : Relays a list of requested special procedures for new zones.  Also
serves as a liason for builders needing new things supported by code prior-to
and during zone development.

The Senior LOW does not, in general, have access to the code files and is
expected to respect the coder's authority over the code files.

<br><br>
LOW Staff : The Senior LOW is thought to be the chief point of contact for the
LOW Staff.  While not technically a manager/supervisor position; the "vision"
of the Senior LOW is penultimate.

<br><br>
Builders : The Senior LOW is charged with being the guardian of the builders,
promoting builders as the succeed, and demoting them if they fail.  The
Senior LOW is granted almost complete autonomy where builders are concerned.
The Senior LOW is expected to insure that builders are adequately trained
and kept informed of relevant news.

<br><br>
MudAdmin : The Senior LOW receive direction for major changes to the tiny files from
   MudAdmin, and provide to them status reports as necessary.
   MudAdmin is expected to identify those areas that are authorized for
   overhaul, but it remains the Senior LOW's authority to volunteer to undertake the
   project(s) that the LOW Staff sees fit.
