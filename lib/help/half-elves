Half-Elves are the result of a relatively rare pairing between a human
and an elf. Neither race is very often fully accepting of the offspring from
such a union. To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they 
look human. Half-Elves are long lived, and will watch their human companions grow
old and die, yet they themselves are not immortal.

Half-Elves tend to have the eyes of their elven parents. Theyâ€™re neither
as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They do however often have the
best qualities both races. Their height, constitution, and strength is relative
to that of of their human parent, while their intellect and physical beauty
are closer to that of their elven kin. Additioanlly their inherent magical
abilities, vision, and natural immunities are derrived from their fey bloodline.

Half-Elven males range from 61 to 73 inches and 116 to 170 pounds.
Half-Elven females range from 60 to 66 inches and 92 to 120 pounds.
They most often use equipment that was designed for humans, but occasionally
they have trouble finding things that are a comfortable fit.

The life of a half-elf is both blesssed and cursed.
They are blessed with many gifts and excel in almost any role.
Sadly they are often outcasts and find great difficulty in finding a 
place where they belong.
