Volume is how much space an item takes up, and every item in the game has a
volume value.  Your character can carry a certain amount of volume and still
maintain enough control of himself to move efficiently.  It makes sense that
a player carrying a 'very large chest' is not going to be able to manage much
else, so a large chest would have a very high volume.  Holding items in your
hands decreases the amount of volume you can manage as those hands become
tied up in holding the object rather than being free to carry other stuff. 
<P>
Volume capacity (the max you can carry at the given time) is affected by
your dexterity and ALSO by what is in your hands.  Obviously, a player
wielding a sword and holding a shield can't juggle as much volume as they
could if both hands were free.  
<P>
Don't confuse volume (a measure of size) with weight (a measure of mass).
Weight capacity is a function of strength.
<P>
The use of bags, backpacks and other containers will help reduce some items
volume as they are packed, crammed, and stuffed inside.  Not everything
is compressed the same; compression depends largely on what sort of material
the item is made of (cloth compresses, steel doesn't).
