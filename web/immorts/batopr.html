<P>Batopr has been associated with SneezyMUD almost as long as Brutius himself. He can take credit for much of
the code and all the help files. Batopr is played by Jeffrey Bennett who lives somewhere in New York. Not much
is known about him personally and he has only been seen in person by a few alums of The Catholic University of
America, none of whom play SneezyMUD regularly anymore. For a short time he had his own web page where I was able
to learn more about him, but alas, the site went down. But I do know that he is engaged to be married next summer
to a wonderful person named Heather. Congratulations you two lovebirds! - Marsh</P>
