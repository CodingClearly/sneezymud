CLASSES OVERVIEW               (Last Updated: Sat Nov  1 14:26:15 1997)

SneezyMUD help for choosing your class :

Class represents your character's profession.  It dictates what set of skills
are possible, as well as influences what your character can and can not do.
SneezyMUD strives to keep all classes balanced, however, that desired balance
may be that a given class is easier and more enjoyable to play at given levels
than others (usually balanced with a more difficult period as well).

One important suggestion, choose a class that appeals to you as opposed to one
you may have heard has a loophole that can be abused (in time, a loophole may be
removed).

Detailed information about these classes is available once you log in and type

- attributes (hits, moves, mana, etc) will be some combination of the classes.
- experience is gained at a reduced rate.
- all skills of all classes owned are available.
- equipment usable by any owned class can be used.
