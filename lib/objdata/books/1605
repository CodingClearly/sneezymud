General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF CONFLICT:

Committed to bringing about a armed conflict, the Faeries devised a scheme
whereby a new race designed to hamper the Elves would be unleashed upon The
World.  Faced with destruction, they theorized, the Elves would have no choice
but to seek the aid of the Faeries - or better yet, to abandon the natural
realm completely and return home to the Faerie realms where they belonged.

A tremendous effort was undertaken, for creation of life itself was not
something the Faeries had previously felt was a proper part of their knowledge.
Using massive quantities of raw magik, they molded their creation until it was
finally ready.

The Faeries rationalized that the Elves would try and use magik to fight
the Dwarves, as this new race was called, and so made the Dwarves powerfully
resistant to both natural and unnatural damage.  However, there seemed little
reason to endow them with great mental powers; in fact, the limited intellect
was seen as a benefit, making the Dwarves single-minded of purpose.  And
the purpose the Faeries stamped deep into the Dwarves was to attack Elves.

In the early days of the struggle, the Elves, unsuspecting and with little
defense from these vicious creatures, took vast losses.  The Dwarves, Having
been crafted from magik, had some intrinsic stores of this energy that they
quickly learned to harness for their task.  They discovered how to sneak up on
their vigilant adversaries by tunneling, and explored the art of metallurgy to
produce weapons.
