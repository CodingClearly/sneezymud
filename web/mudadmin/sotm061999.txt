State of The Mud - Summer 1999

My fellow Mudders-

It is both my pleasure, and my responsibility to report on both the recent
goings on of the MudAdmin board, as well as the plans for the near future.

While 1999 started on a shaky note, with both turmoil and upheaval amongst
the developers and immortal staff that led to a short-term shutdown of the
mud, this hurdle was quickly put behind us, but forced some changes in
structure, policies and focus that have strengthened the mudding community.
While the effects of this have not yet fully trickled down to the average
adventurer, they are beginning to have a profound effect on the way affairs
are conducted amongst the leaders that should ultimately improve the way
things get done, and problems get handled.

We recently released v5.1, that attempted to restore the concepts that
existed in the past, but were mistakenly removed for reasons that are no
longer valid, or to make way for ideas that never panned out.  The deadline
of this project affected the scope of what could be restored, but it now
seems likely that a v5.2 release with a longer horizon will permit addressing
some of the other concepts that are deemed problematic.  While I do not yet
have the specifics of what features will be targetted for v5.2, my
guess is that MudAdmin will take up that debate very shortly.

At the same time, development of the mud was made less exclusive and a number
of new members were added to the development staff.  It's fair to say
that this resulted in some growing pains, but the more people with a stake in
the future of the mud, the more likely it is that the development will
continue, and proceed in the right direction.

I'll apologize in advance for the awkward structure of this address.
This is the first such State of the Mud Address ever given, but keeping
with our new bylaws, a new one should be released every quarter or so.
In any event, I'll now move on to the reports from the various other
members of MudAdmin.

========================

Report of the MudAdmin Chairman (Batopr):

The MudAdmin board, of which I was elected chairman, is charged with setting
the direction of the mud, and acts as a final, deliberative body for making
decisions on the big picture questions.  While many resolutions have been
passed since February, they have been mostly to formally ratify the setup
and other concepts involved with the new governance.  Just recently, 
MudAdmin has delved into setting some limits on the powers of the various
developers in order to avoid outright censorship and forcing us to follow
some common sense procedures before ripping the guts out of existing game
elements.

MudAdmin is still in its infancy, and as such, has had to concentrate on
issues of governance, rather than focusing on the direction questions that
will have the profound effects on the mudding community.

MudAdmin's accomplishments include both the construction of the current setup,
as well as developing the concepts that went into v5.1.  In the coming months,
I expect MudAdmin will begin debating the features and scope of a v5.2 mud,
and to address the other direction of the mud questions that come up based
on ongoing events.

========================

Report of the Operation's Manager on the activities of the Immortal Council
(Damescena)

To date, the ICon has accomplished the following things:

Determined the nature of its procedures.  Issues brought up before
the ICon, may be be taken to a vote for game wide change.

Determined that there will be a mortal council. This mortal council
or the MoCon is still in the formative stages. No determination of
the specific format of the MoCon has been approved. At this point,
open meetings for the general mud populous will be held on occasion,
and issues will at times be presented to the listserv. It is possible
that at some point there will be a call for representatives.

Determined that a player, upon reaching the level of 50 shall be
able to request "immortalization" of their charactor in the world.
This immortalization takes the form of having a mob placed in the
world in your likeness. There are some terms to this, check with
your favorite immortal if you want more information, helpfile to be
forthcoming.

The ICon was originally asked to review the wizlist and to be
responsible for any potential needs for removals. For the most part,
the members of the ICon did not want to have this responsibility. It
was for this reason that the mudadmin moved to shuffle those duties
and also led to the new system of levelless immortals.

========================
Reports of the Developers:
========================

Quest Manager (Omen):

I guess (1) I'm just adding scripts and fixing
bugs on what we have now. Hm, I think I'm also supposed to (2) write up
help files for all the quests but I haven't had time to even figure that
out yet. Also, I'm (3) working on the web and recently redid all the
javascript and fixed a few more pages. Web authoring programs write really
buggy and unflexible code :P

========================

LOW Staff Member (Sidartha)

Ultimately it would be nice to work on world expansion, but
I feel that that isn't really my role.  I don't know very
much about where zones are going, until I get them presented
to me.

Mithros and I have talked a bit about world expansion, and
we would like to see some boundries hashed out - we just
need to come to agreement on the scope.

1) Work on getting all in limbo zones in the game - this
includes some that have been on the shelf for some time now.
2) Work on getting eq level/price/rent into a reasonable range.
3) Complete building Logrus Castle, and implement.

Aside from the mundane roles that I have - that is really
all that I forsee.

========================

Lord of Worlds (Mithros)

The LOW staff has or will within the next day or two complete:

- River & Cavern zone outside Obsidian Citadel
- Armagedon's Amber Bay Zone
- Coral's Forest Expansion
- Lothar's Graveyard
- Syl's Faction Mansion
- Adder's Coffee House (Dolgan)
- Grimhaven Outer Pathway (Dolgan)
- Mage Robe Quest Added for Moath
- Several small additions such as:
  - standard quiver made and added to bow shops
  - various new "low level" weapons to fill some holes
  - fixed component scripts pricing to accomodate new prices
  - made all mage spellbags closeable
  - ect.
- Began work on the Quest toggle "descriptions" for the QUEST command.
  (Thanks to Gringar & Lapsos for added help in this area)

Right now the following is on my list:

I am trying or plan to work at getting all older zones rebalanced and
brought up to par if they are grossely unused.  Such zones are Lionheart,
the Circle, Gold's Magical Land, Auria, Tanelorn, ect.  Several builders
are working on some of these already.

Working on getting a few "unfinished" zones into the game.  These zones
were started by immortals that either have since left, been let go, or
have moved on to other more time consuming duties and have given
permission for their zones to be finished.  Have at least two of these in
the Q with assigned builders.

Working with the other LOW staff to get all current zones into the game,
many have been shelved for some time with little things holding them back.
Two prime examples of this are Dames' Islands and Albria's Tower.

Trying to start defining the coastline and general shape to the Grimhaven
continent.  Once those boundaries are laid will be working to "flesh" out
the interior as best we can complete with various levels such as more
caverns, aerial/tree heights type areas, connecting all roads/waterways in
sensible fashions, ect.  This has been started with Armagedon & Custer's
work on the Amber/Brightmoon Bays/Seas.

Planning to get builders to work on bringing the other cities up to speed
with more localized zones about them.  At this time I have no plans to use
these as "starting" cities.  The effort to go through and redesign all
these cities and their surroundings is just effort that could much better
be used elsewhere imho.  Dolgan has zones planned for north of BM, and the
Sidartha/Omen/Gringar team is apparently working on something near Logrus.

Hoping to get armor/weapons better balanced and assist Batopr with
reworking the MED/OED systems.  Moving more to a "set level" type of
things instead of leaving numbers to builders which can be confusing for
them as well as creating a lot of inbalance between zones/mobs/objects.

Continueing my personal work on Ranger Quests, Level 21 quest is complete
as far as mobs/objects/rooms.  All that is left is for me to write the
scripts.  Level 28, 35, & 42 quests to follow.

Will be providing full support to Lapsos to assure he has any objects he
needs to go ahead with implementation of the Applied Substance code for
Rangers.  As well as other "creation" code such as whittling, bowing, &
fletching.

And finally will be continueing work on my personal zones.  Next one has
all rooms & mobs done.  Started work on the objects, zonefile and quests
to go.  Will be "centaur-like" race of ogre porportioned half
feline/humaniod plainsman folk called Simal.  Is a small village and
plains area off of my river zone currently in.

OK, appears like a lot, but really with my position a lot of it is
"overseeing" and getting others to work on these things, so its not as big
as it seems.

========================

Programmer (Peel)

Currently working on code for smoked drugs (pipeweed, opium, etc) that
will include affects and (possibly) semi-complex addiction affects
that should also be applicable to alcohol.

I don't have any other code projects planned and I'm focusing more on
mudsex er building than anything else.

========================

       2.  Adding pet feeding in
       3.  Making pet handling more skill based
       4.  Adding pet life in
       5.  Adding in specific pet training over time

II. Afflictions Discipline
   A.  Still in formulation

LONG TERM:

========================

Programmer (Brutius)

I am in the process of releasing a new version of the client, and will
continue to work on that, and all the server related code for the client.
I will also continue to do small bug/idea implementation as I have time.

========================

Coder (Lapsos)

  Over the next 4-6 weeks i'll not be able to put in as much time as
normal, will still clear all the needed numbers just not as much as I
currently do.  Am working on moving and am in the pre-process of
everything.
  Basic things I intend:
    Continuation of ranger work.  Rangers actually have come farther than
      they look but are still far away from the goal.  I intend to
      continue my work on them as I have and will most likely kick into
      higher gear to get certain things in and done as soon as possible.
    Skills/Spells/Ect...  I've got a number of ideas lined up for new mage
      spells and a number of other skills/prayers for the other classes.
      If all goes well with the ranger work I would like to get the grunt
      of them in by the next release.
    Other stuff.  Alot of other things on my table, most will not even be
      attempted for the next version, but are open to anyone else who
      wants to take them on.  Just catch me online and i'll tell you where
      to find the stuff, if you dunno the path already.

  Things that would be nice:
    Pets:
      I think it might be time to start seriously reconsidering our pet
      standing.  When we first introduced them they seemed so much less
      battle geared and more towards 'just for fun'.  Lately it seems
      everyone wants the biggest baddest pet so they can whack the biggest
      baddest monsters on the mud.  Mith's idea collection has alot of
      good use in it and might be worthy to flesh out at least Some of the
      ideas in it and put them in.

  Well that's what is primarily on my mind.

========================

Coder (Batopr)

  Much of my recent work, and some of my future plans center on what I
  commonly call "infrastructure" projects.  These are basically behind-the-
  scenes projects that improve the efficiency, stability, or maintainability of
  the code base, but (ideally) should not be noticible by the actual user.

  For about the last 8 months, my primary project has been the balance
  initiative.  This project concluded with the release of v5.1.  However,
  the repercussions of the assumptions that were made are having drastic
  effects, both on playability and on game design related to balance.
  It's my opinion that a second pass on balance, in which we go back to
  first principles, and build back up from scratch ought to be done, and I
  am currently identifying the goals for such a project, anticipating that
  it will be authorized for a v5.2 version of the mud.

  As a short term project, and a necessary precursor to a second balance
  initiative, I will probably overhaul a number of the builder's tools to
  store data in a more intuitive fashion (to the builder), which I hope will
  also keep mobs and objects from changing dramatically each time we make
  small adjustments in the gaming system.  For the most part, this means that
  we will no longer save a mob as "has 50 HP", but instead save "has HP of
  level 5.5 mob".  Seeing that builders usually have a poor grasp of mob
  stats, and think in terms of "make it hit like a L10, but have HP of L1"
  this seems like the proper approach.

  I am also working with Cosmo on some of his discipline ideas.  For the most
  part, my interest lies in how the classes are conceptualized and how that
  relates to balance.  One of the things that became clear to me during the
  final phases of the balance initiative is that it is very hard to create
  certain classes as both able to solo, as well as having the advantages to
  a group that have become expected.  While this primarily applies to the
  mage and cleric classes, other classes may also be affected.  I am pushing
  for us to separate the two concepts into separate classes, where we would
  have one mage class that had a journeys solo focus (spells for boosting HP
  of caster, boost caster's AC, moderate damage spells).  And we would have
  a separate mage class with the journeys grouped focus (casts armor on
  a tank, has minimal AC and HP development, has high damage capability).

  On a personal note, I will be doing that grownup thing shortly, and 
  buying a house (closing scheduled for the end of the month).  I would
  expect that becoming a homeowner will adversely affect the time I am able 
  to spend on the mud.

Reports of Other Immortals:
===========================

Coral:

I have finished my first zone and I'm currently working on it's expansion.
Did I mention that when building, it's hard to see from a player's
perspective? God, i just feel like my zone sucks hehe

Anyway, I've been doing some work with new deikhans quests. Mostly to give
deikhans an option regarding the prizes they get from completing the quest.
Currently they only get slash weapons, so i'm doing some blunt weapons.

Next, or all at once, I plan on making an elf village of some sort, with
several levels and classes, due the lack of equip etc elves have today.
