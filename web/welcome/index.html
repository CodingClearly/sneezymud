					<p><b>Well my friend, it seems our Realm has grown, new magics have been unleashed, and the very scope of our adventures have been reshaped by the hands of the gods.  I hope you'll continue your adventures, or begin a new one, here within the realms of
                    SneezyMUD!</b></p>
					<p><b>Here you will hopefully find adventure, enjoyment, and a welcome place in the taverns to tell your tales. The Immortals of the realm have placed themselves at your disposal to create a realm in which you can forget the toils of your borish world and droll life.  Hopefully through these writtings you will gain the knowledge to survive the harsh adventures of the realm, the spark of interest to explore those far off regions or darkest holes, and a better knowledge and understanding of your fellow adventurers. So continue reading and let us start with the simple history of events leading to the SneezyMUD world you will see today.&nbsp;</b></p>
					<p>I'm happy to welcome you to SneezyMUD on behalf of the implementors,
                    gods, and devoted players.  SneezyMUD began its history in May of 1992 from
                    stock SillyMUD code acquired by Brutius.  Since that time SneezyMUD has&nbsp;
                    went through massive changes and three complete code upgrades brought about
                    by thousands of man-hours put in by the coding staff and the Sneezy
                    builders.  SneezyMUD is now one of the top MUDs on the internet for its
                    unique world and features.  In the upgrade to version 4.0 SneezyMUD has
                    been completely converted to C++ code and almost all traces of Diku or
                    SillyMUD code are now gone.</p>
					<p>SneezyMUD Invitation:  You are hereby invited to try one of the most
                    dynamic, fun, and complete fantasy muds on the internet.  The dynamism
                    comes from the attitude of the immortal staff.  The fun from the spirit,
                    attitude and general playfulness of our players.  The depth of features
                    and completeness has come from *constant* coding for 6+ years.  Not 6
                    months from diku stock, or 2 years, but 6+ full years of mud coding from
                    some of the most ambitious and dedicated mud coders on the internet.</p>
					<p>SneezyMud's new version is SneezyMud 5.1. Those of you who tried Sneezy
                    2.5, 3.0, or 4.0 already know the advanced state of our code. We hope
                    you will be pleased by the advances since those code versions.  Those of you
                    who tried 4.0 will be also be surprised at the changes since 4.0.
                    Although similar to 4.0, SneezyMud 5.x has many more features and its
                    balance has been shifted around a bit making it a slightly different and
                    better mud.  Those who have not tried Sneezy will be amazed at the code,
                    world, and <a href="features.html">features</a>.</p>
