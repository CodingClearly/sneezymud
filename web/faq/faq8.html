<P>
You will often see something like:
<PRE>A hard roll is here. [2]</PRE>

This denotes that there are 2 (number in brackets) of the item specified.<BR>
Similarly:
<PRE>A barhopper wanders the streets.  [4]</PRE>
This implies 4 barhoppers are in the room with you.<BR>
The default reference is the first one in the room.  If you want to
reference the 2nd, 3rd, ... object, use this format:
<P>
(command) 2.(object)    <-- references the 2nd thing of type (object)<BR>
eg.<BR>
get 2.roll<BR>
kick 3.guard<BR>
buy 7.sword<BR>
