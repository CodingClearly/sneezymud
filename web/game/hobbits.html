      <h1 align="right">Hobbit Territorial Backgrounds</h1>
      <p>As you will learn, your character's characteristics are largely governed
      by your racial selection. Territorial selection serves as a modifier on
      these natural stats. So in essence, you are choosing a sub-race here that
      will slightly offset the characteristics of your racial norm.</p>
      <p>Territorial choice does NOT grant any additional skills within the
      game. However, some skills may be impacted directly or indirectly by your
      choice of background. The chief effect of territorial choice is to modify
      your natural racial stats. </p>
      <hr>
      <p><b>Urban</b>: A city dweller. Your parents left the simple life behind
      to move to a large urban center. Your family is probably highly involved
      in politics, trade or commerce. You benefited from the resources in the
      city, and became well educated. However, you have become somewhat detached
      from the traditional hobbit way of life, and have also suffered from the
      ennui that besets all urban dwellers.</p>
      <p><b>Shire</b> <b>Hobbit</b>: You have had the average hobbit upbringing
      in a typical hobbit shire. Your family was surrounded by many other hobbit
      families, and you are well versed in the traditions and beliefs of your
      race. You have had good access to the facilities of civilization. </p>
      <p><b>Grassland</b> <b>Hobbit</b>: Your parent's wanderlust led them
      through the rolling plains and grasslands of The World, where they
      ultimately settled down. You did not grow up in total seclusion, for there
      were a handful of other hobbit communities, as well as communities of
      other civilized races, scattered around. However, neither were the
      accouterments and trappings of civilization easily accessible. </p>
      <p><b>Hill</b> <b>Hobbit</b>: Your parent's wanderlust led them through
      the rolling hills and steppes of The World, where they ultimately settled
      down. Few other civilized folks lived nearby, and you seldom saw anyone
      but those you lived with. You learned to make due, and to do without for
      many things. Nevertheless, you remember your upbringing as a happy time
      and you are highly self-sufficient as a result. </p>
      <p><b>Woodland</b> <b>Hobbit</b>: Your parent's wanderlust led them
      through the lush forests of The World, where they ultimately settled down.
      Your folk turned to hunting, logging and other trade based on the products
      of the forest. You had minimal contact with others, mostly those that had
      similar professions, or those that your family would need contact with in
      the normal course of commerce. Your learning came mostly from your other
      family members, and that that you discovered on your own. You had a
      healthy lifestyle. </p>
      <p><b>Maritime</b> <b>Hobbit</b>: Your parent's wanderlust led them
      through the low-lying coast-lands of The World, where they ultimately
      settled down. Your family took to fishing, or was otherwise engaged in
      maritime activities. As with most that take to the sea, your family took
      to bonding with others to accomplish shared goals, and you had good
      contact both with others of your own kind, as well as those of other
      races. Only during the off-season did you have the opportunity for a
      formal education, but your healthy living kept you occupied and content. </p>
      <hr>
      <p>Most hobbit tribes are civilized, although a small number have shunned
      contact with the Civilized Races, and are thus regarded as wild tribes.
      Wild tribes often differ in characteristics from those of their civilized
      brethren due to long-time genetic inbreeding (and in some cases,
      cross-breeding with other wild races). Wild hobbit tribes vary in
      disposition and characteristic, some are merely xenophobic, while others
      have allied with dark forces and are fundamentally opposed to the
      existence of all of civilization. Some wild tribes are such just because
      of political due to their location. </p>
      <p>The Kendar tribes are the most notable amongst the wild tribes. Little
      is known about this reclusive society, and contact with them is often
      dangerous. </p>
      <p>Players are not permitted to play members of the wild races due to the
      fact that they would be unwelcome within the bounds of civilization.
