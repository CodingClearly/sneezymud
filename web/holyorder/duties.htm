			<h4>In the Knighthood of Melchizedek</h4>
			<P><font size="3">Thy primary concern is to minister to the spiritual well being of the Holy Order . There will
			arise many dissensions and conflicts over time, perhaps as well schisms in the Knighthood. Only through the leadership
			and consul of the Holy Orders seasoned members will feelings be calmed and love be re-instated as paramount. The
			body of High Crusaders are to fill the Judgment Seats of Brightmoon. They will officiate over any claims of wrong
			doing, whether within of without the Brotherhood, brought before them. These proceedings shall include the hearing
			of members proposed for excommunication or to have their names withdrawn from the records of the Holy Order . These
			hearings must be filled with the spirit of forgiveness and understanding for all people. They must be fair and
			just and take into consideration the repentant heart of the individual. Following such a hearing the High Crusaders
			are to report their decisions to the Apostles of Administration , as well as Internal Communication for the processing
			of the membership records. <BR>
			<BR>
			These same principles and proceedings will be necessary for the trial of detained Prisoners of War . Under the
			direction of the Guardian of the Steps , a council of High Crusaders are to try and penalize captured parties.
			These hearings must be performed impartially and without malice or feelings of retribution, but with the same sentiments
			of love and forgiveness one would apply to ones own brother. The decision is to be delivered unto the Guardian
			with the corresponding date of release and penalty if there be any. The Guardian will then free the individual
			according to this verdict. Justice is the foundation of the Holy Order doctrine and Elyon will be the true Judge
			of iniquity. Thy duty is simply to listen to his council and administer the verdict. <BR>
			<BR>
			High Crusaders of the Holy Order are to ordain worthy Aaronic Knights to the Melchizedek Knighthood, or Elders
			to the office of High Crusader only after the sustaining vote of the Brotherhood is attained. If there are any
			opposed the matter must be discussed and pondered till a unanimous decision can be acquired. After extending the
			calling to a particular office within the Holy Order , a High Crusader must then insure his or her willingness
			to continue to serve others both within and without the Order, as well as sustain the Edicts of Faith and Tenets
			of Membership. <BR>
			<BR>
			Once sure of the sincerity and intent of an individual, and if ordaining to the office of an High Crusader or of
			an Elder with the approval of the body of Knights, a High Crusader may then ordain him or her to an office appropriate
			to not only their level of experience, but also their degree of faith. It may be necessary for a Knight to proceed
			through offices normally held by those of younger nature in order to better prepare for the fullness of the Knighthood.
			When Knighting another a High Crusader should call that person by naming asking them to kneel; Assure that they
			have read, understand and will commit to the Edicts of Faith and Tenets of Membership; Laying ones hands or holy
			blade upon either the Head (if by hand) or the right shoulder (if by sword) and stating ones authority as a High
			Crusader in the Holy Order of Melchizedek, knight the individual to his or her appropriate sphere (whether it be
			Melchizedek or Aaronic ), as well as ordain them to a corresponding office within that sphere of the Order . Then
			as directed by ones feelings pronounce words of encouragement and upliftment welcoming them into the Knighthood.
			These ceremonies will be the source of great excitement and rejoicing in the lives of many. Strive to assure they
			are spiritually motivating and reverent. <BR>
			<BR>
			Finally, High Crusaders are to fill the Presidency of the Melchizedek Knighthoods. They are to serve within the
			body of Elders as wizened leaders. The President of the Knighthood will be a High Crusader set apart by the Prophet
			or one of his Apostles. In like manner shall his counselors be ordained and set apart. They are to officiate in
			the administration of the Knighthood counseling with the Apostle of Administration . The Presidency of the Melchizedek
			Knighthood is to gain direction from the Quorum of the 12, yet are solely responsible for the governing of the
			Knighthood body. High Crusaders should feel free to call meetings of the Knighthood at their discretion. <BR>
			<BR>
			You have been consecrated and set apart as a father over a numerous people. Let you faith be a tower of strength
			to those whom you diligently serve. <BR>

			<h4>In the Knighthood of Melchizedek</h4>
			<P><font size="3">The voice of Elyon came unto me saying, <BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;O ye Elders of Galek hearken now unto these words. It is has been given unto you all that is mine, ye but
			have to search. Seek therefore and ye shall find, knock and it may be opened unto you. For ye are the meat of mine
			house. See that my people are taught more perfectly, and have experience, and know more perfectly concerning their
			duty, and the things which I require at their hands. Continue to reveal unto them true nature of the doctrine of
			Galek and that of the Prophets throughout the ages. Lead all thine meetings as directed by me for I will speak
			words unto thee. Yea and I will give unto thee according to that which I have said and that which I will yet reveal.
			And never wilt the right hand offend the left. For my words are eternal and unchanging. Yea, it is only thine understanding
			which changest. Be ye therefore Perfect in thine understanding.&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Encompassing all Aaronic duties, An Elder of the Knighthood of Melchizedek now is given the fullness of the Knighthood.
			You are to exemplify all that a Knight is and should be. An Elder is to teach the Eyes of Elyon to the people with
			power and authority from the great creator, Elyon . You are to be bold in denouncing immorality and wickedness.
			For that is thy primary concern to minister of the spiritual well being of the Holy Order . <BR>
			<BR>
			Elders of the Holy Order are to be responsible for the Home Teaching Program of the Knighthood. The Home Teaching
			Program is thus; All Knights are to be assigned a Home Teacher. The Home Teacher is to watch over that individuals
			needs both temporally as well as spiritually. They are to be a friend and confidant. A Home Teacher is to know
			when there is financial stress either monetarily or in the realm of personal needs. Then their duty is to report
			such needs to the Apostle of Welfare , and, pending his evaluation, receive assistance to bestow upon his home
			teachee. Once a month a Home Teacher is to share a short message with their assignment from either the Eyes of
			Elyon or the other printed material of the Knighthood. Elders are to be assigned to all members of the Knighthood
			regardless of office. Know your home teaching assignments brethren, this is the most crucial of all knighthood
			responsibilities. <BR>
			<BR>
			In this manner the needs of members shall be accommodated and we may all learn service, sacrifice and love. <BR>
			<BR>
			Elder s of the Holy Order are to ordain worthy Aaronic Knights to the Melchizedek Knighthood only after the sustaining
			vote of the Brotherhood is attained. If there are any opposed the matter must be discussed and pondered till a
			unanimous decision can be attained. After extending the calling to a particular office within the Holy Order ,

			<H6><font size="3">In the Knighthood of Aaron</font></H6>
			<P><font size="3">Thy Crusade hitherto has been to aid and assist the body of Knighthood itself. Now having increased
			faith and experience within the brotherhood ye are called to preach the message of truth and love to all The World.
			Go ye therefore hence and be a guide to all of the realms. Let thy light shine forth through example as well
			as exhortation. <BR>
			<BR>
			Herein lies the Duty of a Crusader to teach, expound and exhort the doctrine of Galek and that of the Prophets
			throughout the ages unto the people. It has been said, &quot;Seek ye first to obtain my word, then seek ye to declare
			it.&quot; When we feel the happiness and joy that comes from serving within the order we will want to share that
			gift with others. Firstly, a Crusader must become familiar with the Eyes of Elyon and the history of our Brotherhood.
			As this foundation is built, one must also add to it the mortar of our Edicts of Faith and Tenets of Membership
			emphasized in previous callings. Under the direction of the Apostle Mission Leader the Crusader must then make
			it his vision to share the joy and truth found within these doctrines and teachings with all creatures of this
			World. <BR>
			<BR>
			With these additional responsibilities a Crusader does not lose those initial duties of a Deacon or of a Teacher
			which revolve around visiting with the individual members, strengthening and fellowshipping with them. The Home
			Teaching program of the Holy Order continues to be of importance in the life of a Crusader . He can use these times
			to not only to continue getting to know the different members, but also asking them for the names of friends they
			may know who would be interested in their message. <BR>
			<BR>
			The Knighting of another soul is a great responsibility and blessing in the lives of a Crusader . After teaching
			the person and extending the invitation to join with us in the Brotherhood, a Crusader must then insure his or
			her willingness to serve others both within and without the Order, as well as sustain the Edicts of Faith and Tenets
			of Membership. Once sure of the sincerity and intent of an individual a Crusader may then knight him and ordain
			him to an office appropriate to not only their level of experience, but also their degree of faith . It may be
			necessary for a Knight to proceed through offices normally held by those of younger nature in order to better prepare
			for the fullness of the Knighthood. When Knighting another, a Crusader should call that person by name asking them
			to kneel; Assure that they have read, understand and will commit to the Edicts of Faith and Tenets of Membership;
			Laying ones hands or holy blade upon either the Head (if by hand) or the right shoulder (if by sword) and stating
			ones authority as a Crusader in the Holy Order of Aaron knight the individual to his or her respective office within
			the Holy Order of Aaron. Then as impressed by ones feelings, pronounce words of encouragement and upliftment welcoming
			them into the Knighthood. These ceremonies will be the source of great excitement and rejoicing in the lives of
			many. Strive to assure they are spiritually motivating and reverent. <BR>
			<BR>
			Finally, Crusaders must preside over all meetings of the Knighthood of Aaron. They are to conduct and also speak
			to the body of the Knights of Aaron. Crusaders are to gain direction from their Mission Leader, however they are
			the Presiding officers within the Ranks of the Lesser Knighthood of Aaron. <BR>
			<BR>
			The Holy Order thanks you and rejoices in your calling. Be clean, strong and honorable. Lets us again express our
			love to you for what you do and what you stand for. Let you heart, might, mind and strength be centered on the
			sacred office. <BR>

			<H3><A NAME="teacher"></A>The Duties of a Teacher</H3>
			<h4>In the Knighthood of Aaron</h4>
			<P><font size="3">Teachers lay the chief cornerstone of our brotherhood. The Teacher primary role is to watch over
			the Order strengthening them. Using the Edicts of Faith, Tenets of Membership and Eyes of Elyon a Teacher has the
			tools needed to help foster peace and love within the Holy Order , and insure harmony between the members. <BR>
			<BR>
			A Teachers goal should be to assure that there is no iniquity, neither lying, nor backbiting, nor evil speaking
			within the ranks of the Knighthood. <BR>
			<BR>
			This can be done through example, as well was Home Teaching assignments . Encourage others to live the Edicts of
			Faith and Tenets of Membership to which each of them have committed. Encourage the members to pay a full tithe
			and remind them of the blessings that may come from doing so. Always support your leaders even though at times
			you may not agree with the policies decided upon. This will serve to unite us and forge a mighty nation built upon
			peace. <BR>
			<BR>
			In the absence of a Knight of Melchizedek or a Crusader the Teacher is to conduct and preside over all Holy Order
			meetings. Although a Teacher may not Knight others this preparatory time provides many opportunities to fellowship
			with other members as well as participate in the various ordinances of the Knighthood. Through such affiliation
			the procedures and responsibilities akin to such events will become engrained within our hearts. <BR>
			<BR>
			Once again the Brotherhood thanks you all for the great acts of service which you perform on our behalf. Correlate
			often and learn of thy duties. May thy hard work and diligence bring forth much fruit not only within the Brotherhood,
			but also without. <BR>

			<h4>In the Knighthood of Aaron</h4>
			<P><font size="3">The duties of a Deacon lay the foundation for the Holy Order . <BR>
			<BR>
			The primary concern of a deacon is to fellowship new members of the Holy Order . This involves striving to welcome
			the new brethren through the kindness of a friend and patience of a brother. Though yet new in the Order this calling
			provides an opportunity to strengthen fellow deacons, as well as forge bonds that will last throughout your life.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			Deacons are also to participate in ordinances of the Knighthood. This entails being present for the ceremonial
			knighting of new members , as well as the ordination of current members to offices within the Order. <BR>
			<BR>
			Deacons also have the special task of collecting fast offerings for the needy once a month . This entails a fast
			by the members that is used on behalf of those in our community who may be struggling financially. Often what may
			be but a simple days meal to us may provide much for those in need. The members will contribute the money they
			would have spent on their days sustenance while fasting to the Knighthood. This fast offering is a chance to be
			unselfish and sacrifice something we need very much for the welfare of another. <BR>
			<BR>
			This preparatory Knighthood while not possessing all the responsibilities of an Elder is a time to learn service
			and the responsibilities associated with the Title you bear. Strive to be clean in thought, speech and deed. Let
			virtue garnish thy every adventure. Lead by example and you will find treasures richer then those of the mightiest
			dragons. <BR>
			<BR>
			Welcome to the Knighthood Brother (Thy name hither) , <BR>
			may you magnify your calling and learn the gift of Love. <BR>
