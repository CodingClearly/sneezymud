Rules of Conduct for the Forum
<p>
1. Our moderation policy favors the free posting of ideas, but
attempts to keep discourse polite, fair and on-topic.
<p>
2. Posts that degrade the environment will not be tolerated. This will
include (but is not limited to) posts containing material that is
personally defamatory, abusive, threatening, harassing, or
intentionally offensive.
<p>
3. We will have a "three strikes and you're out" policy. Upon the
third offense, the offending forum account will be locked out.
<p>
4. Any member of Mudadmin may issue the first warning, second warning
or the subsequent account lockout. If a member Mudadmin cannot perform
these actions directly, the Site Administrator is obliged to do so at
their request.
<p>
5. Any warned or locked out player, or any member of Mudadmin, may
request a review of their circumstances by Mudadmin. A player may
request a review no more than once every 90 days. At the conclusion of
the review, Mudadmin may take whatever action is deemed appropriate,
including revoking lockouts/warnings.
<p>
6. Mudadmin reserves the right to terminate access to anyone for any
reason or no reason.
