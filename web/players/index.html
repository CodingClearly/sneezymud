<A NAME="dillor">
<HR>
<DD>My name is <A HREF="mailto:sd1abee@myhome.net">Dennis Auve</A>.  
I currently play two characters on Sneezy.
Dillor is a hobbit monk, and Woody is an elven deikhan.  I own and
opperate my own business/franchise.  The Headquaters home pages are
located at <A HREF="http://www.excel.com">http://www.excel.com</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.teleglobe.com">http://www.teleglobe.com</A>.  I have three children
all girls ages nine, twelve and fifteen.  I use Sneezy as an escape from
the grind of parental duties that occur from dealing with teenagers and
preteenagers.  Much to the dismay of my wife.  My business is almost as
much fun as playing on Sneezy.  I have no asperations of ever immorting,
I just like to play and talk to all the people that are on the game.  I
have always helped new players and always will.  If you log on and need
assistance you can tell to me and I will help if I am able.

<A NAME="heafstad">
<HR>
Character: Heafstad
<P>
<DD>I am Heafstad-Son-Of-Unfearth, and I have spoken. The youth of today
have no valor. No courage of kings.
<P>
<DD>    When I was a young man, we wore bone helmets and horns that
proclaimed our kinship with valorous deeds of courage.    We wore
hairshirts that ripped our flesh even as we drank our mead. And we
fought for great treasures known across this
middle earth!
<P>
<DD>      My father, Unfearth-The-Spirited, once sacked an entire mead-hall
for a bloody boar's head hanging from the door. This was his treasure.
He wore it and became known as Unfearth-The-Boar's-Head. Where is such
valor today?
<P>
<DD>      Last week, I spied a young man exchanging talens for a "Snickers"
candy bar. Money? Exchange? Where is the honor in
such an act? And further, he did not even stab the cashier when he left.
<P>
<DD>      I am Heafstad, son of Unfearth, who wore Banloc, the sword of the
Scyldings, as a token of his valor. I sacked for gold and jewels. I have
lost patience with today's youth, with their "music" and their
"automobiles." I demand viking ships, spears, swords and torture
devices.
<P>
<DD>      I recently saw a young maiden taking part in a most shameful
exchange. She was providing fellow citizens coffee in return
for paper currency. What has this nation-state come to? Hwaet! Lo!
<P>
<DD>      I want swords! Fire! I want sacking and burning! Where is the
courage in negotiation? Without deeds of valor and courage,
how do we remember the name of Wealtheow The Peaceweaver? We do not, I
tell you.
<P>
<DD>      When I was a young viking, we sacked for the sake of sacking. We
burned for the sake of burning. I sacked and stabbed
for the treasures of the Geatmaecgas. I slaughtered friend and foe,
monster and demon. I  once slew an
entire village. Banloc the Brilliant once took 500 in that time. Where
is that valor today? Lost! Lost!
<P>
<DD>      Walking through my city-state the other day, I spied some lads
playing "basketball." Worthless rabble! Gone are the days
when we thought everyone to be the enemy, and we committed great crimes
against humanity.
<P>
<DD>      These youths must be armed with byrnes and shields, with swords
and helmets hewn from the bones of great beasts
slaughtered in battle. They must raid and sack and pillage.
<P>
<DD>      I, Heafstad, took Banloc and smote Ecgtheow, leader of the Danes,
at the battle of Finnsburgh. On that day a great many
heads were lost. But no one smites anymore.
<P>
<DD>      This morning I saw a group of children running around playing tag.
And who was killed? No one! There was no carnage, no
headless beasts, nothing. And for what? Again, I say, nothing. No head
of the wicked Grendel, no houses of kings, no spoils at
all.
<P>
<DD>      You call this valor? We need sacking and burning! The whole of
this middle earth will be destroyed without the might of its
people. We will perish in the depths of the dark abyss, leaving no name
behind. The need for valor is urgent, the time of
reckoning imminent. Nation's youth, hear me and hear me well: I know all
of this, for I am Heafstad, prince of that fame known
across this land, and I have spoken! Aaaarrrggghh!

<A NAME="jimbus">
<HR>
Name: Jimbus<BR>
Real Name: Jim Babcock<BR>
Age: 34<BR>
<P>
Chars: Supernaut, Jokal, Jaxom, Auberon, Lumpy, Gore, Spanky
Bio: I started on Sneezy way back at sprinkle.cray.com, telnetting in
from Youngstown State University's amdahl 360 mainframe. My first char
was an ogre warrior/thief named Lumpy. I managed to get him to about
15th before the machine was lost. About the same time I was finding
myself really burnt out from full time school and working 2 jobs 60-70
hours a week.. I was getting ready to take a break from school, even
thought I was only a hand full of classes from graduating, when a friend
got me a lead on a job in Detroit. Now, here I am... Programming for a
new start up (my original company spun us off) that does web tag based
"glue ware" for legacy, database and PDM systems (mainframe, unnix and
NT), mudding and dating someone wonderful.

<DD>I tend to play non-humans and hybred classes, just because. I like
hobbit thieves (Jokal) dwarven deikhans (Supernaut), elven rangers
(auberon), elven, hobbit and ogre monks (Jaxom, Spanky and Gore). I'd
like to see some more hybreds developed... like Bards. I tend to only
get as high as the teens or low twenties. Partially because of my low
patience threshold, but also because I feel mudding at work limits my
abililty to leave town or group.

an occasional game of Magic: The Gathering, Honk Kong movies, and
consuming large qauntities of malt liquor. You can learn more about
the latter at my web site
