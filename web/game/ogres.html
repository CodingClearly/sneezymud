      <h1 align="right">Ogre Territorial Backgrounds</h1>
      <p>As you will learn, your character's characteristics are largely governed
      by your racial selection. Territorial selection serves as a modifier on
      these natural stats. So in essence, you are choosing a sub-race here that
      will slightly offset the characteristics of your racial norm.</p>
      <p>Territorial choice does NOT grant any additional skills within the
      game. However, some skills may be impacted directly or indirectly by your
      choice of background. The chief effect of territorial choice is to modify
      your natural racial stats. </p>
      <hr>
      <p>Villager: While no ogre clan has yet moved into a major urban
      center, this is about as close as they have come. You were born to one of
      the ogre clans that has had long contact with the other Civilized Races.
      For an ogre, you had excellent access to education and medical facilities,
      and the traditions of ogredom have been left firmly behind.</p>
      <p>Plains Ogre: You were born to a nomadic ogre clan, that in ancient
      times hunted the great plains of The World. In recent times, hardship had
      beset your clan as the resources of the plains became more scarce. To
      survive, your clan made contact with surrounding clans, and began
      primitive barter that ultimately led to begrudging acceptance of the ways
      of the Civilized Races. Your upbringing was fairly average, and you had
      equal contact with those clansman that advocated the advantages of the
      Civilized Races, and those that advocated a return to the old ways.</p>
      <p>Hill Ogre: Born to one of the many small pockets of ogredom that roam
      the many hills of The World, most of your fellow clansmen were content in
      their wild lifestyle. However, your clan leader had become enticed by the
      advantages of Civilization, and decreed a change in behavior that none
      would challenge. You were taught the traditions of your clan despite the
      fact that the clan leader has required they be set aside. While many of
      your other clansmen would revert to their wild behavior at their first
      opportunity, you have also seen your leader's greater vision and have
      become on of the truly civilized ogres. </p>
      <hr>
      <p>The Ogre races are the most recent addition to those of the Civilized
      Races. In fact, the great majority of ogre clans remain wild and it is
      only those clans that have had long exposure and contact that opted to
      formerly join with the Civilized Races when the opportunity presented. The
      wild ogre clans may differ in characteristics from those of their
      civilized brethren due to long-time genetic inbreeding. Additionally, they
      tend to vary in disposition and characteristics; some are merely
      xenophobic, while others remain completely primitive in nature.</p>
      <p>Players are not permitted to play members of the wild races due to the
      fact that they would be unwelcome within the bounds of civilization. </XMP>
