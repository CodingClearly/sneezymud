<h1><strong><u>Temporary Page for SneezyMUD Client</u></strong></h1>

<p>Sorry about this, but I needed to get the new client up
because of some bugs in the MUD, and I didn't have time to put
together a new client web page. Look for that in the next couple
of days.</p>

<p>If you do not have IE 5.0 or Windows 98, and you have never
downloaded the client, you MUST DOWNLOAD the <a
href="410comupd.exe">Microsoft Common Controls update</a>.</p>

<p>Distribution of the client and sounds has been separated for easier maintenance and availability.

<ul><ul>
<p><a href="clientnosound.exe">SneezyMUD Client (925KB).</a></p>
<p><a href="../sounds/Grimhaven_MSP_Sounds.zip">Current Sounds archive (12.679M) (ZIP format).</a></p>
</ul></ul>
