<DD><I><B>Well here you have found the SneezyMUD FAQ, Frequently Asked Questions, a handle little reference tool if I may say so.  Hopefully the questions and answers you will find here can help you in your adventurers whether you are just starting out or a seasoned hero.  Please be warned, like the Newbie Guide this document was originally written for the 4.1 version of the MUD and may contain fragments of outdated information.  We should be updating this information soon.</B></I><BR>
