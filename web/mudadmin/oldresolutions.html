Resolutions of the MudAdmin
</font>

<font size="2">
<p>
These are the resolutions under which the mud is governed.  They are numbered in the order that they were proposed, but I have chosen to list them here in a more logical order.

Not all votes are recorded.  Votes concerning membership, promotion and demotion are explicitely not recorded.

documents are required to protect the ownership of the MUD by the group, and
to ensure the wishes of the group (as perceived by Ben) are met.  Ben will be
given authority to choose proper terminology and phrasing when constructing
this document.
<p><p>
<big><strong>

partnership or the requirements for "code access" must be approved by 4/5
of the MudAdmin and 2/3 of the current partners.

MudAdmin Voting
</big></strong>
<p><p>

23.) Resolved, all members of the MudAdmin board have a single vote which they
may cast.
<p>
24.) Resolved, Only the chairman of the board may actually call a vote.  The
chair may put before the board a vote on any issue the chair sees fit.
Additionally, members of the board may request the chairman call a vote
on a resolution, and it falls upon the chairman to accept this request and
put a vote before the board, or to decline to vote on the requested
resolution.  If the
chairman declines to call a vote on a resolution, a member of the board may
draft a resolution, and upon it being seconded by another member of the board,
a vote on that resolution is called.
<p>
25.) Resolved, All votes of the MudAdmin are to be submitted and responded to
via email.
<p>
26.) Resolved, A vote is initiated when it meets the criteria for a vote to be
called, a resolution is drafted, and the resolution is submitted to all current
members of the MudAdmin board.  The voting period extends for 24 hours after
the resolution is submitted to all members.  <i>If a vote fails to receive the
necessary quorum of votes to consider it valid, the vote may be extended for
an additional 24 hours at the discretion of the chairman.</i>
<br>
81.) Resolved, Resolution 26 shall be amended.  The sentence reading:
"If a vote fails to receive the necessary quorum of votes to consider
it valid, the vote may be extended for an additional 24 hours at the
discretion of the chairman."
shall be striken.

<p>
82.) Resolved, If a vote fails to receive the necessary quorum of votes to consider
it valid within the 24 hour period, it may still be considered valid
if votes are received from all members within a reasonable duration of time.
The chairman will be required to inform the board when the 24 hour period
has passed, and that the vote is being extended in this manner.

<p>
27.) Resolved, A previous resolution that received a quorum of votes may only
be reviewed again upon majority vote of the MudAdmin board.  In such
a case, a vote must be called to reopen the dead issue, and only if it passes
will new resolutions on that issue be allowed.

<p>
20.) Resolved, A vote of the MudAdmin board is only considered valid if 3/4 of
the current members cast a vote.  Any vote where fewer than 3/4 of the current
members vote may not be considered valid.
<p>
41.) Resolved, All votes of the MudAdmin, except those specifically noted,
are assumed to be decided by majority decision of those people casting votes.
A vote may only be considered decided if enough votes to establish quorum
exist.
<p>
52.) Resolved, Any resolution that raises the voting requirement to something
other than majority rule may only be amended by a vote of the MudAdmin at the
voting requirement of the resolution being changed.
<p>
74.) Resolved, A member of the MudAdmin is expected to recuse themselves from
voting on any issue that presents itself as a conflict of interest for
that member to be voting upon.  A vote of recusal shall neither count

ICon.  No builder shall be considered a god, nor granted the privledges of
ICon membership until the agreement is obtained, and ratified.<br>
151.) Resolution 97 shall be amended. The phrase "This agreement shall

<p><p>
<big><strong>
Direction of the MUD
</big></strong>
<p><p>

79.) Resolved, At the earliest possible time as the coders see fit, development of
the v5.0 mud will cease and no further updates to it (save to fix crash bugs
and close exploits) will be done.  At such point in time, further development
will be done on a v5.1 mud.
<p>
80.) Resolved, The abstract of the v5.1 mud shall read:
<br>
<i>
v5.1 will be focused on reintroducing concepts that worked in prior versions
but that were removed in favor of code that is now viewed as problematic.
v5.1 will NOT introduce radical new concepts that have yet to be tried.  v5.1's
main intent is to provide a stable, feature-rich, enjoyable code base in a
minimal amount of time.
</i>
<p>
102.) Resolved, The concept of "levels" for immortals shall be removed.  Immortal
powers shall be assigned to individuals on a case by case basis.  The
mechanism for this shall be left to the coders as an implementation detail.
A given power may be conferred or revoked by any member of the MudAdmin.
If a power is revoked, notification of the MudAdmin is expected.
<p>
103.) Resolved, With all possible speed, the v5.1 version shall be put into production
on port 7900.  The previous v5.0 version shall also be available on port 7901
for a period of not less than 3 days, and will be disconnected when all
problems associated with the upgrade are resolved, at the discretion of the
coders.
<p>
105.) Resolved, It shall be our policy to offer as much depth and detail as
is feasible given our technical constraints in terms of what is
textually presented to users of the mud.
<p>
106.) Resolved, Textual descriptions may deviate from the accepted policy delving
into "less decent" aspects of life, provided that it makes reasonable
sense to do so, provided that innocent bystanders are shielded, and
provided that an appropriate filtering process is devised to warn anyone
that might be insulted or offended to steer clear.  At no time shall
such an aspect be developed as a required event for a player, and should
only be developed for fleshing out a detail that makes legitimate sense.
<p>
107.) Resolved, At no time should the textual description of anything be vulgar for
the sake of being vulgar.  It is permissible to be exceptionally graphic
in describing something, but there is a fine line between worthwhile
description and senseless vulgarity.
<p>
108.) Resolved, It shall be the responsibility of the respective position head (LOW,
coder or quest manager) to enforce the appropriate standards in their
respective areas.  It shall not be appropriate for those people to act as
censors, but it is permissible for them to ask for objectionable aspects
to be rewritten so as to comply with the standards.
<p>
109.) Resolved, The position heads
may refuse to add a sub-par element unless it gets rewritten, but are
specifically not entitled to remove an element that has been activated in
the past.  In this latter case, they are free to have the element rewritten,
but can not remove the element pending that rewrite.
<p>
157.) Provided that logistical details be acceptably worked out,
SneezyMUD will move to new server hardware that will be co-located at
Saw.net.  Peel will assume administrative duties of the machine as
well as the "Site Provider" title per resolution 70.
<p>
158.) If the server move in resolution 157 occurs, Kriebly will be
offered an untitled seat on Mudadmin per resolution 50.

and decisive factor in such a way to balance the needs of the players and
the needs of the game designer.
<br>

the ICon, or to overturning the MudAdmin's right to set the direction of the
mud.<br>

decision of the ICon, or to" shall be stricken.
