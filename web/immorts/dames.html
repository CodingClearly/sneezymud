Damescena, record holder for the longest time spent building one zone on SneezyMUD, has
been around since 3.x. She spent many happy moments casting away, as the mage Weef. While
Weef never managed to enter the ranks of the remarkable, Damescena aka Alice, became hooked.
You can find her building beautiful wilds, and she hopes to continue enhancing the world for
a long time to come. As a fantasy role player from teenage days, there was no turning back.
What started with the reading of Tolkien, and then endless other fantasy based novels, led
her to the lands she now frequents far too often.
<P>
In her 'other' life, Alice is the mother of 5 wonderful children. A piano and flute teacher
and a bead and tie-dye artist. She considers herself 'an eclectic' with interests ranging
from reading (if it's a book, she'll read it), gardening (with a particular love for flowers
and herbs), and cooking (she is an avid reader of cookbooks), to natural healing, natural
parenting, and all things aesthetic. She is proud to have birthed 3 of her children at home,
with wonderful midwives  and lends her expertise to other women as a support person for
nursing mothers. On a final note, she loves and misses very much the Grateful Dead, and
can often be found dancing around the house with a baby in arms, singing along with Jerry
and the boys. She is proud to be sneezyMUDs residant hippie.
