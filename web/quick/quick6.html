<P>Players' prerequisites have
been centralized to a class discipine and this has allowed the classes to be much more ordered and balanced at lower to mid levels.  This was the primary motivation for the changes in these areas.</P>

<P>In 4.1, a caster would get a spell that was designed for a level 15 mage at
level 5.  He would learn a low level spell like gust after that one rather than before.  No
spells were learned at the appropriate time except by coincidence.  This caused us to put in
complex prerequisites and to put weird things into classes to try to catch up to the weird
skill sets. This meant that in general, Sneezy 4.1 casters were identical between levels 20
and 25 because of prerequisites and were unbalanced both before and after those
levels.</P>

<P>Ultimately, the idea of full choice of skills at low levels is a balance
nightmare and we never saw the diversity that was the primary goal of that system.  At low
levels, there were clearly preferred paths for every class because not every discipline can be
equal. It is very difficult to provide choice, make everything equal and make it understandable.  We believe it is not possible to do that and maintain balance.</P>

<P>We have substituted
diversity in actual learning, racial diversity, and have added meaningful specialization in
place of diversity in practices. Specializations have meanings in the 5.0 systems where you do
not max a discipline in 8 levels of practice but must both use the skill and pick the
specialty when you get out of your basic discipline.  Every skill and spell is
associated with advanced
disciplines and specialization will change the effects of basic skills.  Some of these effects
will be apparent (see help files for some effects), some invisible and structural.  Using a
skill will increase your abilities of even basic skills in those specialities.  Know that
there are diversities in identically practiced players based on their choices in using skills.
 At higher levels, people will actually get different skill sets as they sink practices into
the assortment of advanced disciplines.</P>

<P>The above will explain why some advanced disciplines have no or few
apparent skills.  We hope to eventually have several skills in every advanced discipline but the discipline learning has an independent effect.</P>

<P>In any event, please understand the reason why your low
level choices are more restricted.  It is so no character learns meaningless skills at
inappropriate levels.  Restricting choice was not our goal but the tradeoff for what we tried
to accomplish.  It has allowed us to immediately make the ranger and mage classes playable and it will allow us to balance skills and classes easily against each other.</P>

<P>We believe
that this will be more understandable to newcomers to Sneezy and increases the overall
enjoyment of the mud.  In looking at this system please be aware that there are different
diversities in place in terms of what skills you use.  If you do not use bash versus kick, you
will have no bash and be as diverse as a 4.1 fighter who never got bash. There are less
options but it will be more understandable and perhaps more diverse.</P>
