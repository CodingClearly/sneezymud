(player killing, and player looting)
<P>
SneezyMUD has tried various methods of dealing with these two problems in
the past.  The current rules can be found in the newbie guide.
<P>
We encourage players to handle their own affairs without the intervention
of a god.  The exception to this rule is where a newbie (level 1-5) is
concerned.  Newbies are HANDS OFF without the explicit ok of a god to
deal with them.  This is so characters who are learning the rules are
not turned off by some quick-to-retaliate player.  In the case where a
newbie is on just causing havoc, gods will generally authorize their killing
BUT you do need to get that authorization or face penalty.
<P>
If the players are both over level 5, gods won't interfere except in extreme
cases.
