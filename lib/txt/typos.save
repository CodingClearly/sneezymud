LOW: (Mithros/Omen/Sidartha)
----------------------------

Consolidated:
-------------
OMEN: Keep an eye out for any non-rentable quest prop items,
      **I fixed a few of my own personal quests like this (mith)
SID: Find out for sure what Stone wanted his molten gear sized.
     If he did want dwarf let him resize armor and hell spawns
SID: Check over "rumors" for currentness.

Grimhaven Pathway: Few desc errors due to east gate not being in, 
                   will leave for now with the hopes that east gate will
                   be completed soon.  (4461, 4462, ect)

- Add locking option to GH gates, some sort of bar which can
  only be used for quests and only lockable from inside walls

The corpse of a snow leopard can not be skinned. Why not?  I thought a skin was made for this animal. 
[Dolgan] This is mine...seems we don't have a hide for the snow leopard.
Damm, I thought Knighit made hides for every concievable creature. Duh!

Subject: charge changes
Whoever changed charge from X mob doesnt give you room to charge to 'there isnt enough room.' (which was my idea, thanks)    The new sentance goes something like this There isn't enough room.MOB_NAME stays close to you.  Between the period and the MOB_NAM

E there should be a space, there isn't.

Subject: [Typo] FEMALE NPC - Name : trainer mage drow priestess basic advanced [M-Num: 218]
how about giving the priestess 
defrocked in her name? say its one of the main things in her short descript that defines her from the other priestess's of drow. 'defrocked' that is.
