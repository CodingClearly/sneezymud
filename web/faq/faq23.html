<P>
While you do need to be able to see an object on your body in order to
remove it by name: "remove glove", "remove sword", you are able to
remove whatever it is you are wearing on your "hand" simply because you
know where your hand is.  Logical, no?
<P>
To do this though, use the following syntax:<br>
remove (slot-name)
<P>
eg:
remove head<BR>
remove waist<BR>
remove hand-left        <-- for gloves<BR>
remove leg-right<BR>
remove hold-right       <-- for weapons/shields
<P>
You should be able to remove some weapon, then hold your lantern and light it.
This will hopefully make it no longer dark.
