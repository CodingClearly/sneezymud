Resources for <b>SneezyMUD</b>:</p>

<p align="left">
The SneezyMUD Resources section contains some useful information on a number of aspects of play.  Links are in the right-hand column.  Other useful sources of information are other players, especially those who have labeled themselves as 'Newbie-Helpers,' and an extensive library of in-game help files.  There is also an active discussion board at <a href="phpBB2/">sneezy.saw.net/phpBB2</a>.
