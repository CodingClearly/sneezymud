\par 
\par This is the name or title of the room.  It is always shown, regardless of
\par brief mode.  Additionally, the EXITS command displays the room name next
\par to the room direction.
\par 
\par The words in the room name should ALL be capitalized except for:
\par a, an, the, of, to, in, on, and, out, or   (and other short prepositionals)
\par 
\par The first word in the name is ALWAYS capitalized. No Period at end.

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Description
\par 
\par The description is the long textual portion of a room.  It can be toggled
\par on and off with the brief command.  The editor does NOT format your text
\par so remember to hit return before you enter your 81st character or you will get text that looks like this :)
\par 
\par Initial spaces are ignored so if you want indentation, you must start your line
\par with a ", hit the space bar once for each space you want, and then hit " again.
\par The standard room indentation at the beginning of the description is TWO
\par spaces: "  "This is how to start your rooms.  Note the quotation marks.
\par 
\par Room descriptions should be all one paragraph.  The more you write, the more
\par likely it is people will turn on brief mode.  The idea here is to be concise
\par but to also give people the mood and feel of the place they are in.  Try 
\par to bring a story for the zone to life in your descriptions.
\par 
\par THINGS TO WATCH FOR:
\par 
\par MENTION WINDOWS AND DOORS: Windows (object types) and all doors should be
\par explicitly mentioned in the description.  Windows because they aren't
\par displayed as objects, and doors because a closed door will not appear
\par under the exits command.  Do avoid mentioning things like "a locked door"
\par "a closed gate" as the actual position the door or gate is in will change
\par while the room-text can not. 
\par 
\par DO NOT MENTION NON-PERMANENT ITEMS AND CREATURES: Items and creatures in
\par the room should NOT be mentioned.  The creature should be a mob, and the
\par item would be an object each having appropriate descriptions of their own. 
\par If you have something very trivial (like moss, lichen, gravel, etc) you
\par can mention it in the description (rather than making a stupid obj for it)
\par BUT you should make sure you set up an extra description (see below) for
\par it so that if they look at something they see in the description it won't
\par say "you don't see that here". 
\par 
\par GIVE CLUES TO SECRET ROOMS: If you are designing secrets to be found by a
\par pc, it is likely that you will have to put your first clue in the room
\par description so make sure that rooms that should have clues, have
\par appropriate clues. 
\par 
\par 
\par NON-DIRECTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS: Also, it is BAD to assume that characters
\par have entered from a given direction. Examples of this would be: "You come
\par through a door and a cavern stretches away before you."  What if they are
\par coming back?  Then you would want it to say "The cavern ends, but a simple
\par door presents itself as a path onward." Since you can't have two
\par descriptions, you must generalize your text. "This is the southern end of
\par a large cavern that stretches northward out of sight.  There is a simple
\par door in the south wall."  Now it doesn't matter if they are coming in or
\par exiting, the description is still accurate.

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Flags
\par 
\par Room flags denote characteristics the room has.  They are mostly used
\par internally by the code.  Do not think you have to make extensive use of
\par these flags to build a good zone.  They should be used sparingly and in
\par context.  In addition, some of the flags should not be used in your zone
\par at all (private) and some only in conjunction with others
\par (i.e..peaceful/noheal). 
\par 
\par always lit:     AVOID setting - make lamps, torches etc if you want light
\par death:          kills creatures that enter.   somewhat frowned upon
\par nomob:          mobs won't wander into these rooms. They can ride or track into
\par indoors:        no weather displayed, no ridden creatures may enter
\par peaceful:       prevents combat
\par nosteal:        prevents the steal command from working
\par no_sum:         can not summon a creature OUT of this room
\par no_portal:      no magical way to LEAVE this kind of room
\par no_magic:       can not use magic in this room.  mob procs WILL work here
\par private:        prevents a god from goto'ing this room if 2 creatures in it
\par silence:        prevents say and shout
\par no_order:       no ordering charms and mounts here
\par no_flee:        prevents fleeing from the room
\par have_to_walk:   no magical way to ENTER this kind of room
\par arena:          characters will not lose xp for dying in this room
\par noheal:         mana/hp regen does not occur  should be set if room is peaceful
\par hospital:       accelerated healing and regeneration

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Sector Types
\par 
\par This represents the type of terrain the "room" is.  It affects movement cost,
\par thickness (scan, ranged weapons), and fullness costs (hunger, thirst, drunk).
\par Additionally, the movement-code looks closely at sector type to determine
\par "how" people are moving (swimming, walking, climbing, flying, falling).
\par 
\par Ultimately, this will also relate to weather/climate.
\par 
\par If you have questions about this, or want a NEW type of terrain, talk to
\par Batopr or the LOW.  You may want to brush up on your knowledge on swimming
\par and gravity (as they relate to the mud) before setting some of these
\par sector types. 
\par 
\par NOTES: 
\par 
\par INDOOR SECTOR TYPES AND ROOM FLAGS: setting a sector as a building/cave
\par does NOT imply that it is indoors.  Remember to set this room flag or you
\par will have it raining inside your cave. 
\par 
\par AIR AND WATER ROOMS:  Be sparing and thoughtful in your use use of 
\par gravity type and water rooms in places where newbies will frequent.  It 
\par is ok to use but be aware, drops will mean deaths and complaints about 
\par deathtraps.  Water rooms can trap newbies who are unlikely to have any 
\par swimming skills.
\par 
\par TELEPORTS: You can set up a TELEPORT room as well.  See HELP EDIT for how
\par to do this, and it might be wise to talk to an experienced builder before
\par you do this.  Teleport rooms CAN NOT be set up in the REDITer.

\par 
\par *** WARNING:  Using edit or REDIT to make an exit between rooms creates
\par both sides of the exit AND changes room flags in the target room.  SEE 
\par NOTES BELOW. *********************************************************
\par 
\par Most of the rooms you build will have simple Euclidean exits and doors
\par made with the REDIT room editor or the edit command.  These tools allow
\par you to make simple and not so simple exits and doors between rooms. 
\par Making good and thoughtful exits is one of the most important aspects of
\par good zone building.  The main thing to realize is that SneezyMUD's code gives
\par you a lot of options in selecting exits.  Do not pin yourself down to
\par something till you have looked at all of them. 
\par 
\par The first thing you should do is have practice rooms assigned to you and
\par start using the REDIT editor.  Typing "REDIT" will put you into a menued
\par room editor.  Looking through the REDIT menus is probably the best way to
\par learn the room and exit options available to you.  Do not use edit till 
\par after you have familiarized yourself with REDIT and can fix any errors you 
\par have made in The World.
\par 
\par Most of REDIT is self explanatory.  The REDIT menus allow you to build
\par without doors, to build secret, locked, or pick-only doors, or to make
\par gates portcullis's or a variety of other door types.  Following the
\par different menus you will be able to assign weights, keys, keywords,
\par directions, and decide whether you want the door pick-able or bash-able. 
\par Currently, ward doors are not open-able so should not be used.  Keywords on
\par doors will be used by players so make them reasonable.  Other options,
\par such as gravity rooms, teleporters, and portals will be described
\par elsewhere but should be thought of as alternative exit types. 
\par 
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par WARNING:  Using edit or REDIT to make an exit between rooms creates both
\par sides of the exit AND changes room flags in the target room.  Although
\par this feature is useful in building a zone, it can cause problems when 1)
\par you make a mistake and open an unintended exit to The World or 2) you make
\par an exit between dissimilar room types.  If you make a mistaken exit, fix
\par the room flags and exits in both the room you were in and the room you
\par made an exit too.  If you are uncertain, ask a higher level immortal to
\par help or leave a note.  Please try not to leave weird room flags in world. 
\par Mortals get pissed when The World is not as they expected. 
\par 
\par 
\par USUAL BUILDING ERRORS:
\par  
\par                1. Builders forget to check room flags on both sides of exit
\par                2. Builders make exits to void
\par                3. Builders forget to name Doors
\par                4. Builders don't explore all exit options

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Extra Description
\par 
\par The use of extra descriptions are what set off mediocre builders from good
\par builders.  Extra descriptions are extra text that players read as they
\par explore the room that they are in.  Usually builders build zone clues and
\par the heart of their zone story into their extra descriptions.  Even if you
\par are not telling a story or building in a quest, good zones will ALWAYS
\par have things to look at.  However, what sets off a good zone from a great
\par zone is the use of extra descriptions to tell a story and setup puzzles
\par for the players to solve. 
\par 
\par An extra description is referenced by players by typing "look at 
\par (x)".   Builders build them in the REDIT menu. 
\par 
\par Understand that you can build in layers.  You can have clues to an extra 
\par description in the room description and clues to additional extra 
\par descriptions embedded in that first extra description.  This is an
\par especially useful in giving out clues to secret doors.
\par 
\par Keywords: This is a space separated list where each word is one of the
\par words that is substituted for (x) above.  Players can abbreviate so you
\par don't need to have separate keywords for both "wall" and "walls", you should
\par just set up the word "walls" as a keyword.  In selecting keywords, you 
\par must be cognizant of what objects will be in room so that you don't embed 
\par a keyword behind another keyword making it unusable.
\par 
\par Extra Description Text: The text you type is what will be displayed when 
\par someone types look <at> keyword. 
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par RECOMMENDED/REQUIRED EXTRA DESCRIPTIONS:  You almost always should use an 
\par extra description in the following building situations:
\par 
\par    Secret Doors: You should always put at least one extra descriptions in
\par       a  room if you have a secret door in the room.  (See the long note 
\par       on secret doors at the end of this volume.) 
\par    Teleport Rooms: If your room is a teleport room, you can set up
\par       an extra description with keyword: _tele_ This text will be shown
\par       when the character is teleported. 
\par 
\par 
\par REDUNDANT KEYWORDS: You do not need both picture and pictures or wall and 
\par walls.  Just use the plural of all keywords.
\par 
\par CHECK YOUR KEYWORDS FOR BLOCKAGES:  It is possible to have keywords block
\par other keywords.  Room keywords can also interfere with object keywords. 
\par It is also possible to not leave enough hints so that players can find the
\par keyword.  Make sure after you build that all keywords are findable by the
\par player.

\par 
\par Default is 0 = unlimited.  Any positive number represents the maximum
\par number of creatures that can be in the room at one time.  Mobs and mounts

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Room Height
\par 
\par Room height is in inches.  Room height is used to make narrow spaces and 
\par cause coded affects in players.   For example, a player can only crawl 
\par into a room if he/she is 110% taller than the room height.  The code will 
\par also cause tall players to bump their heads causing some damage if they 
\par enter small rooms.  You must set outdoor rooms unlimited height (-1) 
\par and set a room height for indoor heights (normal height is about 120).
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par RELATION TO MOB HEIGHT:  You must set your room heights in expectation of
\par what mobs you are going to have occupy them and what players you want
\par playing them.  Room height must also be set in relation to flee/track
\par paths for large mobs and wander paths for large non-sentinel mobs.  For
\par example, if you are going to have a dragon in a cave.  You must build the
\par path to the inside cave of sufficient height so the dragon can get to the
\par surface. 
\par 
\par REQUIRED SETTINGS:   You must set outdoor rooms to unlimited room 
\par heights. You must not have unlimited heights in indoor rooms.  
\par 
\par RECOMMENDED SETTINGS:  The most common room heights are 120 for inside 
\par rooms if you are not trying to have a restricted room and unlimited for 
\par outdoor rooms.

\par 
\par *** WARNING:  Using edit or REDIT to make a door between rooms creates
\par both sides of the exit AND changes room flags in the target room.  SEE 
\par NOTES BELOW. *********************************************************
\par 
\par You will make doors in the REDIT editor or with the edit command.  Please 
\par familiarize yourself with REDIT before you play with the edit command 
\par (mostly so that you can fix anything you cause).
\par  
\par The doors portion of the REDIT editor is easy to get to and for the most
\par part self-explanatory. However, you will encounter some menu items that
\par may not be immediately clear: name, weight, condition, wards, keys. Door
\par type. 
\par 
\par Door Name: This is the "name" of the door.  It will be used in conjunction
\par with the doortype in setting the command to manipulate the door.  Most of 
\par your doors will be named "door" so that players will type "open door".  
\par If you want more than one name to open the door, you can add names.  Make 
\par sure the first word is the one you want echoed to room.  For example 
\par naming a door "door iron" will cause player to open door when he types 
\par open iron.  Naming it "iron door" will cause him to open iron.  It is 
\par recommended that you use "door" as the first keyword.
\par 
\par Door type: Play around with these. For the most part these affect the 
\par text players will see when they open and shut the door.  For example if 
\par you use gate, the door will unlatch rather than open.  If you need a new 
\par doortype, talk to Batopr or the LOW.
\par 
\par Weight:  Door weight is related to the player strength attribute.  The
\par weight of the door determines what strength is required to open the door. 
\par For the most part up to weight=15 it is linear (i.e. a pc with strength=14
\par can not open a door which you have set to 15).  After this the formula
\par changes somewhat.  Please be thoughtful about making heavy doors.  In
\par addition, although maybe coded in future, players can not at this time
\par pool their strengths on a door so the max weight you should set on any
\par door would be 19. 
\par 
\par Key Number: If you make a locked door, you will encounter "Key Number". 
\par This refers to the database number (vnum) of the key you will be making to
\par open the door.  Only a key with that vnum will open the door.  You will
\par make the key later but should assign it a number now.  You should use the
\par number of the room for the key for simplicities sake.  For example, if
\par your zone is rooms 1900-2100 and you are building a locked door from 1954
\par to 1955, you should use key number 1954 or 1955.  Be aware that you will
\par have to use this same number later when you make your objects. 
\par 
\par Other options: You have a number of other exit choices available to you
\par other than the simple exits you can make in the room editors.  If you have
\par an object in the room which will be the same keyword as the door itself,
\par you should see the LOW to get a unique door type made for that room.  In
\par addition, subject to the availability of a coder, you can make word doors
\par or have special room/exit procedures coded if you have an interesting door
\par idea and a coder is willing to undertake the project. 
\par 
\par Using the edit command:  After you have explored your options and have
\par become comfortable with using the REDIT room editor, you might want to
\par explore the edit command. The edit command is usually used by experienced
\par builders to make exits fast without having to go through REDIT menus.  Do
\par not use this command till you are comfortable with REDIT and can fix any
\par problems you create using the edit command.  There is help edit to help
\par you learn this command. 
\par 
\par Teleport Rooms: The edit command is also the only way you can make
\par teleport rooms which are another exit option.  Teleport rooms are
\par described later in this book.  The other options you have for exits are to
\par make a room only reachable by magic spells or reachable by flying,
\par climbing, swimming, or water-breathing players. 
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par WARNING:  Using edit or REDIT to make a door to a room creates both sides
\par of the exit AND changes room flags in the target room.  Although this
\par feature is useful in building a zone, it can cause problems when 1) you
\par make a mistake and open an unintended exit to The World or 2) you make an
\par exit between dissimilar room types.  If you make a mistaken exit, fix the
\par room flags and exits in both the room you were in and the room you made an
\par exit too.  If you are uncertain, ask a higher level immortal for help or
\par leave a note.  Please try not to leave weird room flags in world.  Mortals
\par get pissed when The World is not as they expected. 
\par 
\par OTHER CHAPTERS:  Later in this book, you will see chapters on doors, 
\par secret doors, and teleport rooms that will give some further details.

\par USUAL BUILDER ERRORS:
\par                1. Builders forget to check room flags on 
\par                   both sides of exit
\par                2. Builders make exits to void
\par                3. Builders forget to name Doors
\par                4. Builders don't explore all exit options

\par 
\par Secret doors have their place in a FRP environment, however, don't get
\par carried away with these.  The ONLY way to detect these at present is via
\par the thief SEARCH/DETECT SECRET command.  Secret doors are an option in 
\par both the REDIT editor and the edit command.
\par 
\par If you have a secret door, you MUST do the following if you want PC's to have
\par any chance at all of finding your door.
\par 
\par Something in the room description should be eyecatching or out of the
\par ordinary.  "The walls are made of stucco."
\par 
\par An extra description must be set up that reveals something a LOT out of the
\par ordinary, or a series of descriptions must be set up.
\par 
\par walls stucco:  "Millions of tiny bumps dot the wall.  The bumps on one part
\par of the wall seem to have been rubbed smooth."
\par bumps smooth part: "The stucco here has been rubbed smooth.  Probably because
\par there is a button concealed nearby."
\par button: "Pushing the button would OPEN THE STUCCO wall."
\par ---> the secret doors name would then be "stucco".
\par 
\par You MUST have at bare minimum ONE extra description for each secret door.
\par Also remember the "other" side of the door will be secret too, so you may
\par want to say something in the room description on the far-side too like:
\par "The secret passage through the stucco wall you passed through lies somewhere
\par around here.  Now where did it go?"

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Saving and loading rooms
\par 
\par The relevant commands are RSAVE and RLOAD.  (See the help files on each)
\par These commands have some very important features/problem areas and 
\par are responsible for the most common and costly builder errors.
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par OVERWRITING PREVIOUS WORK:  When you RSAVE your work, your former save
\par file is deleted and replaced with your new save.  This means that if you
\par screw up, you can and *will* easily wipe out a ton of work you have done.
\par The most common errors come from not saving *all* of your built rooms (See
\par Using a RSAVE Macro below) and trying to save a temporary building project
\par before the LOW has told you that your rooms have been backed up and it is
\par safe to save.  If the LOW gives you an assignment or you need to save
\par rooms that you have built *and* you have been working on a zone, do not
\par RSAVE these new rooms till the LOW has told you that it is safe to do so. 
\par 
\par USE A RSAVE MACRO:  You should ALWAYS RLOAD and RSAVE all rooms in your
\par zone.  SneezyMUD has on-line aliases and most people use clients.  You should
\par only RSAVE and RLOAD using a macro/alias that does your save or load
\par accurately each time so that an accidentally typo doesn't cost you.

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {The existing mud:
\par 
\par Changing anything in the existing mud is something you should not contemplate
\par until you are at least 54th level.  Players get awful upset if a room that
\par has always been peaceful before suddenly changes, or a deathtrap strangely 
\par appears in center-square.  Be EXTREMELY careful making exits.
\par 
\par If you DO accidentally mess up the real mud, tell someone ASAP.  It is far
\par better to have the problem corrected BEFORE it means doing a reimbursement,
\par then to have to do the reimbursement and then have to go check the logs to
\par see which dumb immortal screwed up the mud and didn't even bother to tell
\par someone about it.
\par 
\par This does mean though that you should NOT connect your work-in-progress zone
\par to the existing mud.  The connection is normally done by the Lord of Worlds
\par as the final act of zone making and corresponds to making the zone active.
\par Until the zone is declared ready to be made active, it should not be hooked
\par to the existing mud.
