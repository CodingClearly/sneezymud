      <p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Warrior</b></font>
      <p>Warriors are characters highly trained in the art of war and how to
      fight. They typically desire high strengths as well as high constitutions.<br>
      <br>
      They are skilled in the use of weapons and armor and possess many
      offensive combat abilities, both armed and unarmed. Their propensity to
      dish out as well as take damage is unequaled.

      <p>Mages are practitioners of magic of a wide variety of uses. While they
      have a certain control over nature through the use of magic, the cost in
      time, mana and materials often makes such control impractical or less
      effective than direct control. For example, why summon a minor fire
      elemental to light your candle when a match is at hand? Nor has the art of
      magic advanced to the state where it surpasses what a deity can cause via
      direct divine intervention. Nevertheless, magic and the mages that wield
      it are definitely a force to be reckoned with.<p><b>Mage Disciplines:</b><br>

      skilled at stealth and deviousness. They typically want a high dexterity
      and high karma. They have some unique capabilities that few possess, such
      as picking locks and trap knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      While not combat-oriented, their study makes them the object of other's
      hatred often enough that they have developed many underhanded abilities
      disdained by true fighters. Their skills center on thieving, looting and

size="4"><b>Cleric</b></font><p>Clerics are the mouthpieces of
      the deities upon The World acting as conduits for the will of and power of
      the deity they follow. Clerics commune directly with their deity through
      the use of prayers and holy symbols, and hence a strict adherence to the
      principles and dogma of their deity is necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Clerical prayers come in many varieties, although they are best known for
      their healing abilities or for the afflictions they can generate. Less
      well known but much more impressive is the ability to channel the power of
      their deity directly upon The World causing destruction on a grand scale.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that clerics do not use &quot;magic&quot; per se, but
      instead ask their deity to answer their prayers and cause a desired
      effect. As such, they do not use mana, but instead, each successive use of
      a prayer lowers their standing in the eyes of their deity.<p><b>Cleric

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Ranger</b></font><p>Rangers are a warrior
      subclass. Rangers are those individuals that have grown up in the
      wilderness and have become accustomed to both its dangers and its gifts.
      Ranger's forego some of the advanced teachings that true warriors can
      receive in order to hone their special abilities and become one with the
      nature around them.<br>
      <br>
      Rangers are born hunters, and their long association with woodland
      creatures gives them not only excessive knowledge of such creatures but
      also a limited ability to control (supplemented with natural magic) them.
      Accustomed to the wide open spaces, their weapon of choice is the bow.
      Rangers are the only class capable of specializing in ranged combat.<br>
      <br>
      Rangers have developed limited natural magic by which they accomplish some
      of the tasks that make this class unique. While this magic is in no way of
      a caliber with a true sorcerer, it does enable them to achieve somewhat
      more than would otherwise be expected. Because of their magical
      background, Rangers shun the use of metal armor.<p><b>Ranger Disciplines:</b><br>

      represent some of the many variations of martial artists. In their most
      basic form, monks train themselves to push physical and mental limits,
      mastering the use and manipulation of internal energies. As a result of
      their training, they become living weapons capable of powerful strikes and
      lightning quick attacks. But, with great power comes great responsibility.
      A monk will often face choices about how he or she will use their power.<p><b>Monk

      deikhan represents a deity's champion. As a group, they represent a holy
      army that serves as the deity's sword arm, enforcing the deity's will and
      defending the deity's holdings. They combine the power of a fighter with
      the prayer ability of a cleric to good measure.<br>
      <br>
      Deikhans are adept at combat and hand to hand combat, and rank with the
      best of them when it comes to a fight. Additionally, they have some skills
      bestowed by their deity and can beseech aid in the form of a prayer when
      it is needed. The various Deikhan orders have developed mounted combat to
      a high degree of skill, and hence, some special mounted attack forms are
      theirs to command.<p><b>Deikhan Disciplines:</b><br>

consider the Shaman to be a cultish subclass of a cleric or mage, however their beliefs 
seperate the Shaman from all others.<p>Shamen are masters of the dead and the undead. They call the spirits of the ancestors 
to aid, or to do harm. The dead watch and care for the Shaman, but demand great effort for 
their service to the Shaman. The creatures of the world and the elements contained only serve 
the purposes of a Houngan. What would normally be considered trash or undesirable to others 
gives power to the Shaman.<p>In order for the loa (grouping of the most powerful of the Shaman's ancestors) to be 
appeased and aid a Houngan, the life force of other living things must be gathered to serve as 
the channel of power. The souls of other living things are what keeps the Shaman a very powerful being.<p><b>Shaman Disciplines:</b><br>
