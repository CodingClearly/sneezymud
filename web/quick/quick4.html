		<p>Stats are divided into Physical, Mental and Utility attributes.
		There are more of them and the scale is much broader than past
		versions of Sneezy, growing by a factor of 10. This is
		a new system and will be unfamilar. We implemented in this manner
		so as to obtain more diversity in stats and to make Sneezy more
		race and skill based. We also were highly motivated by past balance
		meetings in which players asked us to 1) make stats more diverse
		and 2) decrease the emphasis on warriors maximizing their physical
		stats and casters only maximizing their mental stats. We had no
		actual diversity on 4.1 even though theoretically it was possible.
		The primary goal of our stat system design was to try to make
		tradeoff between stats between equal value stats. Thus not every
		player would rob karma for strength or intelligence depending
		on their class. The way things have worked out is that stats, and thus class,
    are almost entirely based on your racial selection. Focus is more based
    on player selection.</p>
		<p>This area has been the most frequently asked question of the beta:
		Why can't you trade between cateories? Understand that our decision
		was conscious and a decision not to allow it rather than something
		we did not think about. We consciously do not allow tradeoffs between
		categories because tradeoffs between unequal stats was one of
		the major problems in obtaining diversity on 4.1 and earlier verions.
		Every warrior was stupid and maximized their available strength,
		dexterity and constitution. Every mage was smart and weak. The
		only place where there were differences was between 18 and 19
		in a stat and a 12 was meaningless. We are trying to eliminate
		that problem in this new system. Note that strength for a mage may
		not help him that much but his trade off will be only against
		dexterity or constitution and be majorly offset by race as well. It will
		not be trading a meaningful stat versus a non-meaningful one.
		If you want a certain type of character, look at the races first
		before selecting your tradeoffs. If you want a smart character, you
    cannot pick an ogre. If you want a strong character, you cannot pick
    a hobbit, gnome, or elf.</p>
		<p>One last note. Physical stats are more important for warriors
		still but we have adjusted at the code level (or will if bugged)
		for the fact that warriors will not be maxed physically. Mental
		stats affect all PCs. Intelligence sets the number of practices,
		wisdom sets learning rates and focus determines how well you perform
		a skill. They are hopefully equal in importance and an intelligent
		race warrior may have some advantages that offset his detriments
		from his physical characteristics versus an ogre. That intelligence
		may come from his race or from his tradeoffs within the race.</p>
