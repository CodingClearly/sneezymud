		1: **RESOLVED**<br>
		All members of the ICon have a single vote which they may
cast.<br>

		All votes of the ICon are to be submitted and responded to
via email.<br>
		<br>
		3: **RESOLVED**<br>
		A vote is to be called by the OpMan, a resolution is
drafted, and the<br>
		resolution is submitted to all current members of the ICon.
The voting<br>
		period extends for 24 hours after the resolution is
submitted to all<br>
		members. If a vote fails to receive the necessary quorum of
votes to<br>
		consider it valid, the vote may be extended for an
additional 24 hours<br>
