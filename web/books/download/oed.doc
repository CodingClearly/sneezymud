\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Name
\par 
\par The name field is used mostly internally.  When the character types something
\par like, get (x), look at (x), wear (x) it searches the objects in the room
\par or inventory for a match of (x) and a word in the name field.
\par 
\par Thus, the name field is used to REFERENCE the object.  Do not confuse this
\par with the short_description though (see below).  They will be similar but 
\par not identical in most cases.
\par 
\par It is important to set the space separated list of names up in the correct 
\par order.  The FIRST word in the name field is used by the code in some
\par combat situations.  For instance, the item-damage code shows the first word
\par as follows:
\par 
\par Your (first-name of x) is damaged by Batopr's hit.
\par 
\par so...
\par You want to MAKE SURE that the first word is the most generic definition of
\par the object.  eg.  a huge long sword would have a name field of: sword huge long
\par eg. a platemail helmet would be: helmet platemail mail
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par NAMES AND ITEM CONDITION:  Do not use conditions in your item names..like 
\par "tattered robe" or "rusted shirt".  We have item condition so this will 
\par show as tattered robe (excellent) or rusted shirt (brand new).  Let item 
\par condition speak for itself.
\par 
\par UNIQUE NAMES:  It is *very* important that your item have the first 2 
\par words unique cause of some of the quirks of the shop code.  Shops can not 
\par distinguish between chainmail shirt and chainmail shirt hobbit.  The 
\par solution is to name it chainmail hobbit shirt.
\par 
\par REDUNDANT NAMES:  The code allows abbreviations, hence we don't need both 
\par "plate" and "platemail", but we do need "platemail" and "mail".
\par 
\par CAPITALIZATION AND TRIVIAL WORDS:  The name field should not be
\par capitalized.  Nor should there be trivial words like "of" "the" "a" "an"
\par etc in it. 
\par

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Short Description
\par 
\par The short description of the object is the shortest display of text that will
\par be used to indicate the object.  The short description is used by the 
\par code to refer to objects in most situations players will encounter except 
\par for seeing the item on the ground.  The player will primarily know an 
\par item by its short description name.
\par 
\par Don't confuse this with the name field.  Name is used to refer to the object,
\par short is used to display it.  eg
\par 
\par > get (name)    <-- looks for a match in the name field
\par You get (short)   <-- displays short to tell player what was gotten
\par 
\par Examples of good short descriptions would be:  a short sword, the painting 
\par of Batopr or an ivory breastplate.  Just plug in x for "You get x" when 
\par you make up your shorts. If it makes sense it is probably a decent short 
\par description.
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par LOWERCASE LETTERS:  Do not capitalize the words in a short description.
\par The code knows when to capitalize appropriately.  The only objects that 
\par are capitalized are artifacts.  One exception to this rule is for proper 
\par names. also, DON'T put things like periods on the end of the object.
\par 
\par ITEM CONDITION NAMES:  Do not used condition terms in your item names.  
\par You will get anomalies like "You get a rusty chainmail shirt (brand new) 
\par if you do.

\par 
\par Item type determines what kind of an object it is.  It also changes what the
\par 4-values (see below) will mean.  Pick the one that best applies from the 
\par OED item type menu.
\par 
\par Some of these item types are obsolete, please ask if you use anything out
\par of the ordinary.

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Long Description
\par 
\par The items long description is what is shown when the item is lying on
\par the ground.
\par 
\par It needs to be a complete sentence, starting with a capital letter and ending
\par with a period.  The standard is to have it fit on one line, although you
\par can certainly go over if need be, just make sure you allow for 80 character
\par screenwidths.
\par 
\par eg.
\par A large sword lies here.
\par Someone has left behind a perfectly good blackscale helmet.
\par In one corner of the room sits a oaken desk.
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par CONNECTION WITH SHORT DESCRIPTION AND NAME:  It should not be identical 
\par but give some clue how to manipulate the item meaning the long should 
\par contain all the elements of the short and the item name.

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Weight
\par 
\par This is the items weight in pounds.  Please make an attempt to be accurate
\par in setting equipment weight.  Suits of platemail should weigh 50-70 pounds,
\par yet folks tend to make them lighter then air  :).  
\par 
\par For drink containers, this value should represent the container's EMPTY
\par weight.  Liquid weight is handled automatically.
\par 
\par Weapons should weigh 2*avg_base_damage of the weapon.  The relation 
\par between strength of pc and wield-ability is as follows:
\par   strength 3 to 17         : weight = strength
\par   strength 18/0            : weight = 20 lbs.
\par   strength 18/01 - 18/50   : weight = 22 lbs.
\par   strength 18/51 - 18/75   : weight = 24 lbs.
\par   strength 18/76 - 18/90   : weight = 26 lbs.
\par   strength 18/91 - 18/99   : weight = 28 lbs.
\par   strength 18/100          : weight = 30 lbs.
\par   strength 19              : weight = 32 lbs.
\par   strength 20+             : weight = 40 lbs.
\par 
\par (1) non-primary max weight is 1/2 the shown value.
\par (2) paired max weight is 3/2 the shown value.
\par (3) weapon proficiency may reduce the max weight to some degree.
\par (4) minimum max weight (regardless of strength/proficiency is 4 lbs).
\par (5) max weight for blunt weapons is 4/3 value shown.
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par COMMON BUILDER ERRORS:  Forgetting to set weight at all or setting 
\par totally unrealistic  weights.  Both add a lot of work to the balancing 
\par process.

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Volume
\par 
\par The volume of an object is how much room it occupies. The main effect of
\par volume is that it determines the size of the item and thus, which race(s)
\par can wear an item.  The second effect is that volume determines the amount
\par of free space the item will take up in a players inventory. In this
\par regard, bags and chests have a built in compression ratio (based on
\par material type) that allows them to "fold the item up and squeeze it into a
\par bag". Please set the items volume off of the LARGEST size the item could
\par occupy and let the code do the compressing. 
\par 
\par We expect realistic volume setting.  Please be aware that 1 unit = 1 cubic
\par inch.  Hence something that is a foot on a side is 12 * 12 * 12 = 1728
\par units. Use some common sense when setting item volume and be accurate
\par about it. 
\par 
\par See the note about race and item size (below) to find out about setting 
\par armor size for particular races to wear..
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par COMMON BUILDER ERRORS:  Forgetting to set volume at all or setting 
\par totally unrealistic volume.  Both add a lot of work to the balancing 
\par process.
\par 
\par PAIRED ITEMS:  These require double volume of single items.
\par 
\par VOLUME:  Remember that volume sets which race can wear an item.

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {EXTRA FLAGS
\par 
\par Extra flags determine criteria that the item may have associated with it.
\par The ANTI-(x) stuff determines who is prevented from wearing the object.
\par A multi-class can wear an object provided that any one of their classes
\par is allowed to wear it.  The following are some flags that you will be 
\par able to set on an object with some explanation.
\par 
\par PAIRED: this causes the item to be worn in both left and right slots.  It is
\par    only valid for leg (pair of pants) and hold (2 handed sword).  You can't make
\par    a "pair of shoes", sorry.
\par GLOW: setting this bit causes the item to produce light.  (in proportion to
\par    its volume), adds the text "(glowing)" to the name and reduces the canbeseen
\par    This is the only way to set an object to providing light unless it is 
\par    explicitly item_type light.
\par SHADOWY: This is the opposite of Glow
\par NO_RENT & NO_PURGE: set these flags on all items you are using as furniture
\par    eq. shrubs, trees, desks, tables, beds, chests, rugs, statues, etc...
\par    Some items like keys should not be rent-able.
\par MAGIC: set this if the item has any special magic affects other than AC.
\par STRUNG: Mostly for internal record keeping.  Similar objects use shared
\par    memory for text strings.  This bit is set automatically whenever the
\par    strings are disassociated from heap memory.  It is unlikely that a
\par    builder will need to change this field ever.
\par PROTOTYPE: Set on all objects when OED'd.  Prevents them from falling into
\par    mortal hands.  57th level gods can remove this bit for quests, etc.

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Take flags:
\par 
\par This tells the mud where the item can be worn.  It is pretty 
\par self-explanatory.  The following are explanations of some of the flag 
\par options other than simple ones like on body.
\par 
\par TAKE:  This is important to have set.  Only objects set TAKE may be picked up.
\par 
\par THROW: Mostly for weapons.  Lets the weapon be thrown (using the ranged weapon
\par code).  Any weapon less then about 800 units in volume should be throw-able.
\par Others you may set as appropriate.
\par 
\par HOLD:  This refers to hands and hold-able.  Weapons need to be hold as do 
\par shields.
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par ONLY ONE SLOT:  DO NOT make items wearable in more then 1 slot.  ie, don't
\par have something wearable on the hands and the feet, as the code gets
\par confused. 
\par 
\par USE TRADITIONAL SLOTS:  Avoid making items worn in non-traditional slots. 
\par Cloaks are for the back, not the neck.  Shields are for hold, not the arm.

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {cost/value
\par 
\par This is the item's worth.  The code references this to determine how much
\par it can be bought or sold for, how much it costs to repair or sharpen.  It 
\par should both show what the pc will get for it and also reflect the value 
\par the builder and the mud puts on the object so you need to balance these 
\par figures very carefully.
\par 
\par The objects rent cost is 0.5 * cost per day.  Currently this figure shows 
\par up but is not used by code.
\par 
\par Any object set as cost 40000 or greater is an ARTIFACT.  Similarly, any
\par item intended to be an artifact should be valued at a cost greater than
\par 40000.  Funny how that works :).  
\par 
\par There is no fixed formula for setting an items cost except for some item
\par types.  Moreover since all items have different characteristics, values
\par maybe slightly subjective.  However, there are the guidelines set by
\par existing objects in The World and you should try to fit your items into
\par The World. 
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par GIVE ALL ITEMS A VALUE:  Shops will not buy items whose value is <= 1
\par coin. Receptionists will not let items whose value is < 0 be rented.  You
\par should use the NO_RENT flag to set such items up if you are doing this
\par intentionally.

\par CHECK VALUES:  Use the LOW command if you have it available or check your 
\par values against other objects in The World.

\par 
\par The OED editor will tell you what the 4 values reference.

\par 
\par The maximum structure the item can have.  Structure corresponds to the 
\par strength of the item and how much damage it can take.  Damage and repair 
\par are some of the primary economic regulators of the mud so structure 
\par numbers should be looked at carefully.  
\par 
\par One of the most common errors is to equate AC and high structure. 
\par Although there will in general be a reasonable convergence, the two should
\par not be though of as identical.  Items can give good protection but damage
\par easily. 
\par 
\par The affect of this error in thinking is that there is a tendency to have 
\par high structures on robes and other non-tank items worn by casters.  Mana 
\par items must have considerably lower structure than tanking gear.  We do 
\par not want casters walking around in high AC, high mana, high structure items.
\par You must put in trade-offs between these three object features. 
\par 
\par You can use super low structure to make fragile items with decent affects 
\par that will circulate more than other items.  However, be aware that 
\par players tend to keep such items in bags and not wear them so do not think 
\par of a super low structure as a trade off for a big item affect.

\par NOTES:

\par 
\par Special Procedures are a way of setting your mobs away from the common.
\par It involves coding and LOW permission to get a special procedure made for
\par a mob.  
\par 
\par There are some already coded special procedures you can use. You should
\par get permission to use anything unusual. 
\par 
\par In addition, there are additional special procedures on mobs that you
\par maybe aware of in The World. If you want one of your mobs to act like a
\par mob in The World (like a shopkeeper or merchant) ask the LOW to put a
\par procedure on your mob. 
\par 
\par Last, you can make your own special procedures by mob responses.  For
\par further information, read the quest response book.

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Max Exist:
\par 
\par This controls how many of an item will be in world before an item will 
\par stop loading and before hunting code will be activated (if relevant).
\par This as well as structure and value are the key object values that most 
\par influence the mud economy.  Max_exist should be set according to how 
\par powerful an item is.  Simple items and general purpose items should be 
\par set unlimited (999).  Magic items of any power should be max_exist less 
\par than or equal to 5.  Super items should be set Max_exist=1  Other max_exist 
\par ranges are in the 20-30 range.
\par 
\par You should carefully examine The World for the max_exist of similar 
\par items in The World and set accordingly.  Make good use of LOW command and 
\par help files under policy.
\par 
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par RESTRICT ANY MAGIC ITEM:  You must set a limited max exist if you have 
\par set any form of apply other than simple AC.
\par 
\par SERIOUSLY RESTRICT ARTIFACT QUALITY ITEMS:  You must limit artifacts to 
\par less than 5 in world.
\par 
\par CONFORM YOUR MAX_EXISTS WITH ZONE FILE:  Your max exist should conform 
\par with your max exist in zone file.
\par 
\par CONFORM YOUR MAX_EXISTS WITH ZONE FILE PERCENT LOADS:  Low max_exist items
\par should *not* have hight percentage loads or load on a large number of 
\par mobs.  Simple math will show you if you have a max exist of 5 and you 
\par load it 40 percent of time on 12 different mobs, you will reach your max 
\par exist the first time some group clears a zone.  You should want your 
\par items to load sparingly for a long time or groups will just clear the 
\par zone the first week of production and then never come back.

\par }\pard \s15\nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {Race and item sizing
\par 
\par The code does internal checks on item size and player size to determine if
\par a character can fit into an item.  Here's how the system works.
\par 
\par For any item worn (except neck, finger and wielded/held) it determines the
\par items percent size (%size).  Its %size is the ratio of its volume to a defined
\par 100% size.  The 100% sizes are as follows:
\par   head:   2500        waist:    4000
\par   body:  11000        back:     2500
\par   arm:    2000        leg:      6000
\par   wrist:   400        foot:     1600
\par   hand:    800
\par 
\par If the item is paired (pants), it doubles the 100% value before calculating
\par the %size.
\par 
\par Next it calculates the characters %height.  A character's %height is HEIGHT
\par divided by 70 inches (average human male height).
\par 
\par A character can wear the item provided:
\par 
\par 1.15 * %size > %height > %size * 0.85
\par 
\par The formula is actually this:
\par 
\par perc = height/70 * human-size
\par if vol > perc/0.85, too big
\par if vol < perc/1.15, too small
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par When MAKING objects, just do this.  Get the character that should be able to
\par wear its height, divide by 70.  Multiply this number by the 100% value listed
\par above and use the result as the objects volume.
\par 
\par NOTES:
\par 
\par PAIRED OBJECTS:  Remember to double volume
\par 
\par CONSISTENCY WITH MOB: Make sure the mob on which it will load is the 
\par right height to wear an object.
