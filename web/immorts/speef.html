	<DD>Speef the Hobbit Monk first came to Sneezy during v3.0. He came close to Immortality in 3.1 but finally achieved
	it on May 1, 1997 around 4am :)
	<P>Speef really embodies what I feel to be the true Hobbit. He enjoys spending time with people and having fun.
	He has an insatiable curiosity and loves to explore, regardless of risk. And, despite his size, he can be larger
	than life :)</P>
	<P>Speef plays Cory Tsang in RL. *grin* Really, though, I'm a CS grad student at UIUC and working as a Research
	Assistant in the Visual Interactive Collaborative Environments at NCSA. I'm originally from Miami, FL, but moved in favor of a better
	education :) I'm fairly active in martial arts, archery, and rollerblading. I'm REALLY active in Ballroom Dancing.
	My favorite dances are the West Coast Swing and Hustle, with Nightclub Two-Step and Quickstep close behind. I suppose
	you can consider me a Swing and Disco type person :) In addition, I love to sing and have been a member of several
	choral groups and choirs. I am a Tenor II but I'm also comfortable singing Baritone.</P>
	<P>Enough of that. I'm sure there are enough of you that wonder where the name Speef came from :) Just to put questions
	to rest, it is a nickname I was branded with back in 9th grade (around 1985-86). I asked my friend what it meant
	and he just shrugged. So there is NO REAL MEANING :) Well, no meaning other than what he really is. Speef is...a
	way of life :)</P>
