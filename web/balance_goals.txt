Goals of the second round of rebalancing:

Overview:
- Remove separate scales for NPC and PC
- Raise PC HP scale to 1000-1200 for human, average level
- Make doubling level predictable and on the order of 4-6 on average
- Lower kills to level to yield better leveling rate
- Tone down effects of AC and make it less crucial
- Increase relative differences between min and max characteristic
- Evaluate "other" powers of a class and devise better gradiant

=====================

Detail:
- Remove separate scales for NPC and PC

Separate scales exist for how much AC, HP and damage a PC and NPC should do.
This leads to constantly converting values based on PC/NPC status, and makes
comparing the two difficult.  

The original rational for the separate scales was that "mobs needed an edge
because players could outsmart them".  This reasoning is not in keeping with
the overall concepts of the balancing initiative.

Putting both on the same scale will allow simpler algorithms (fewer
conversions) and allow direct comparison of raw values.

============================================

- Raise PC HP scale to 1000-1200 for human, average level

Players expectations seem to be that 1000 or so is the right number of HP
for a big bad nasty tank.  A larger number also gives finer resolution, and
doesn't restrict gains to 1-2 HP per level.

Likewise, raising HP helps attenuate the problem of the damage curve yielding
large numbers at high level

============================================

- Make doubling level predictable and on the order of 4-6 on average

The tight-doubling level result in the previous system caused untold problems.
First, it required grouping within a tight level range.  Groupmates just 3-5
levels apart would see giant difference in the XP ratio they would
receive.

Likewise, mobs only a handful of levels different might have big difference
in the XP award.

As a downstream effect, because doubling level was tight, numerous doublings
occurred between L1 and L50, requiring L50 XP to be about 1million times
greater than L1.  The consequence is the "1billion XP to L50" system as well
as the necessity for fractional XP awards.

Since players seem to expect that grouping 3-4 levels apart shouldn't have
"that much of a difference", and that being overly tight with the doubling
level leads to a crazy XP system, changes seem to be mandated.

============================================

- Lower kills to level to yield better leveling rate

The crazy XP system left the "kills per level" formula alone.  This was
apparently a mistake, as what seems to have occurred is that the unbalanced
mud caused some unthinking person to go in and make it require a lot of
mobs to need to be killed in order to level.  

If a single kill is easy, as it was in the unbalanced system, this was
the correct move.  However, with the new definition of fair-fight in place,
and the fact that a single fair-fight is a full-to-zero affair in terms of
commitment, than we need to relax the constraint on how many kills are
required to gain a level, especially in the upper reaches.

============================================

- Tone down effects of AC and make it less crucial

To some degree, this is another fallout of the doubling-level problem.  AC
is a measure of your defensive level.  Since the doubling level was tight,
a small difference in AC meant a modest change in defense-level, but since
it only took a small level-difference to yield the doubling level, this meant
that missing only a small amount of needed AC meant being 1/2 as effective at
defending.

Widening the doubling level ought to address this problem, but keeping in
mind player's perception that "a few points of AC shouldn't have a real
noticible effect".

============================================

- Increase relative differences between min and max characteristic

The present system has min stat being 0.8* the average, while max stat is
1.25* average.  Comparing the max to the min, we realize that the best stat
is only 50% better (1.25/0.8) than the worst.  This doesn't seem to be enough
and makes small a small difference in stats be barely noticible.

However, the range must be constrained by two facts.  Make sure that the
effect of the max stat makes sense.  For instance, if the average value
yields a hit rate (e.g.) of 60% in a fair fight, it would be a bad idea
to make the max stat do double that.  How do you hit 120% of the time?

Also, the larger the range, the greater the effects of coupling become.
That is, we may create a balanced system where one char takes 80 rounds
to kill a mob and can last 80 rounds against that mob, another char takes
125 rounds, but can last 125 rounds before dying.  These two chars are balanced
on the surface since they have the same outcome.  However, if they were to
group, they can do a combined damage of 0.0205 (1/80 + 1/125) dam per round
meaning they kill the mob in 48.8 (1/.0205) rounds.  Combined, they can
tank for 205 rounds, so could kill 4.2025 (205/48.8) mobs.  Separately, they
kill 2 mobs, together, they kill 4.2025 meaning they are 2.1* more powerful
together.  Bottom line is that the bigger the range on these stats, the
more incentive there is to finding someone whose stats counterbalance your
own, and in turn, the more we are emphasizing grouping.

============================================

- Evaluate "other" powers of a class and devise better gradiant

A significant blunder was made when setting up mages and cleric balance trying
to shoehorn them into the warrior-model.  Special powers like sanct, and limb-
gimps that essentially double the caster's power were not accounted for
directly in the balance equations.  As a consequence, steps were put in place
to tone such powers down, to the displeasure of the players, etc. etc.

What should have been done is to realize that this was a "power-doubling"
capability, and to integrate it directly into the overall power function.
That is, to look at the class over its entire career, to determine what the
expected average power should be (like we do for warriors), but then to 
acknowledge that at a certain point, the class doubles its power.  As a
consequence, before that point, its actual power would be less than the 
expected value we devised, and after that point it would be higher.  The
intention would be to make the power loss pre-skill be balanced by the
power-boost post skill.

This concept was originally developed with the thinking that it could/should
just be arbitrarily applied based on "mages should be tough at low level,
but more powerful later on".  While this is absolutely true, we failed to
realize that this is NOT an arbitrary thing and that it is these power-doubling
skills that cause this to occur.

In theory, this allows non-standard spells like paralyze, limb-attacks, sanct
and the like to be worked into the balance scheme, while at the same time
developing quantitatively the easier/harder concept based on where they are
in their career.
