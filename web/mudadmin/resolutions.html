if they so choose.
<p>
97.) A builder may only become a god by the agreement of the LOW (or
the LOW Staff if so designated) and the current OpMan.  This agreement shall

ICon membership until the agreement is obtained, and ratified.<br>

If a power is revoked, notification of the MudAdmin is expected.

<b>Resolutions 104-109 : Jun 3, 1999</b>
<p>
104.) <i>It shall be our policy to strive for a high degree of quality

player under ordinary circumstances.</i> <b>FAILED</b>
<p>
(modest objections to "and decency", thought to contradict our "Adult themes")

is feasible given our technical constraints in terms of what is
textually presented to users of the mud.
<p>
106.) Textual descriptions may deviate from the accepted policy delving
into "less decent" aspects of life, provided that it makes reasonable
sense to do so, provided that innocent bystanders are shielded, and
provided that an appropriate filtering process is devised to warn anyone
that might be insulted or offended to steer clear.  At no time shall
such an aspect be developed as a required event for a player, and should
only be developed for fleshing out a detail that makes legitimate sense.
<p>
107.) At no time should the textual description of anything be vulgar for
the sake of being vulgar.  It is permissible to be exceptionally graphic
in describing something, but there is a fine line between worthwhile
description and senseless vulgarity.
<p>
108.) It shall be the responsibility of the respective position head (LOW,
coder or quest manager) to enforce the appropriate standards in their
respective areas.  It shall not be appropriate for those people to act as
censors, but it is permissible for them to ask for objectionable aspects
to be rewritten so as to comply with the standards.
<p>
109.) The position heads
may refuse to add a sub-par element unless it gets rewritten, but are
specifically not entitled to remove an element that has been activated in
the past.  In this latter case, they are free to have the element rewritten,
but can not remove the element pending that rewrite.

the LOW may unilaterally remove a builder.
<p>
113.) <i>The MudAdmin, by 4/5 vote, may instruct the OpMan to remove a
