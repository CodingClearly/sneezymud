      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE AGE OF FAERIES</B></p>
      <p>At the beginning of time there was The World, and it was rich in magik. Great currents of pure and raw power coursed through the air, the land and the sea. And the Faeriefolk who populated The World turned this power to their own uses in ways inconceivable to even today's greatest wizards. The Faeries were at peace, seeking only to explore the limits of their magikal abilities.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the Faeriefolk had pushed back all the frontiers and learned all there was to know about magik. It had become such a natural part of them that it was impossible to distinguish what was natural and what was magikal. And in fact, the distinction had lost all meaning for the Faeries. Thought was reality, and reality was whatever imagination could devise.</p>
      <p>But there arose a counter-culture. A small band of Faeries began to shun their magikal heritage and explore their natural environment without the use of their powers. To The Elders, this was unnatural and obscene. As the dissidents grew in number, the outrage The Elders felt became more intense.</p>
      <p><font color="#99ffcc">&quot;How can they let themselves be harmed when a mere thought could remove the hazard?&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#ffccff">&quot;They say they wish not to interfere with the natural world; thinking the hazard away would violate their goals.&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#99ffcc">&quot;Fine then, let them shift themselves out of harm's way.&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#ffccff">&quot;I too do not understand.&quot;</font><br>
      </p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE AGE OF RIFT</B></p>
      <p>For a people as similar in purpose and as long in memory as the Faeries to not understand something was a profound problem. It had been millennium since a puzzle had been presented to them, and it was only in their earliest recollections that a problem to which they did not see the solution instantly could be found. Gradually, The Elders concern grew into anger and finally into intolerance.</p>
      <p>An ultimatum was delivered, give up the mad teachings and return to their roots or be exiled forever - and to the Faeries, forever was the only increment of time that they had not yet experienced.</p>
      <p>The dissidents were faced with a problem and they too could not see the solution. Give up their beliefs and way of life, or forsake their heritage. Half of the former dissidents chose the latter course of action.</p>
      <p>The elven historians say it was this outlaw band of Faeries that formed the First Tribe (the High Ones). The Elders final act of spite was to strip these Elves of much of their magikal powers before casting them near defenseless into the hostile and natural World.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE AGE OF GROWTH</B></p>
      <p>But the rift had profound results on both sides. The Faeries were of one people and their powers were entwined both with each other and with The World. Stripping the powers from the First Tribe had weakened the Faerie folk and worse had weakened the powers inherent to The World. With both lessened in strength, the Faeries realized difficulties of their own. Their powers were not as great, nor as far reaching, and slowly they realized that exile was not a viable option.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the First Tribe was having stunning advancements. Having decided to forsake their magikal powers they concentrated on their natural forms. With what was left of their powers, they explored a previously unknown and forbidden realm by taking on the forms of the flora and fauna they found around them. What powers they had left flourished, although no longer could they perform with merely a thought. In time, The First Tribe became the Tribes, and as the powers grew further and the shapes they chose more permanent, the Tribes became known as the Elves. Sixteen bands of Elves dotted The World claiming ownership of the lands, seas and sky when The Elders presented themselves to their prodigal brethren for the first time since the rift.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE AGE OF DISCORD</B></p>
      <p><font color="#99ffcc">&quot;Return at once!&quot;</font> proclaimed the grouped mind of The Elders.</p>
      <p>But the Elves had grown so far from their Faerie forefathers that the command that had been thought at them went unnoticed. <font color="#99ffcc">&quot;Return NOW!&quot;</font> commanded the Faeries, but the demand went unheard as the Elves lacked the ability to hear it, let alone respond to it.</p>
      <p><font color="#99ffcc">&quot;They ignore us,&quot;</font> concluded The Elders, <font color="#99ffcc">&quot;We must force them to come back&quot;.</font><br>
      <font color="#ffccff">&quot;We have never forced our will on our own kind, what you ask can not be done.&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#99ffcc">&quot;But so long as they are not with us, they are not our kind, force them to return&quot;</font> countered the grouped sentience of the Faeries.<br>
      <font color="#ffccff">&quot;This is true, it must be done for all our sakes.&quot;</font> concluded The Elders.<br>
      </p>
      <p>With their first demand ignored (although unknowingly) by the Elves, the Faeries set about performing their first original actions in a thousand millennium. They theorized that if the natural world in which the Elves now dwelled was inhospitable, they would have no choice but to return to the safety of the Faerie realm. Unwilling to alter the environment for fear of further weakening The World further, they set about doing the next best thing, starting a conflict...</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE AGE OF CONFLICT</B></p>
      <p>Committed to bringing about a war, the Faeries devised a scheme whereby a new race designed to hamper the Elves would be unleashed upon The World. Faced with destruction they theorized, the Elves would have no choice but to seek the aid of the Faeries, or better yet, to abandon the natural realm completely and return home to the Faerie realms where they belonged.</p>
      <p>A tremendous effort was undertaken, for creation of life itself was not something the Faeries had felt was a proper part of their previous knowledge. Utilizing massive quantities of raw magik they molded their creation until finally it was ready.</p>
      <p>The Faeries rationalized that the Elves would try and use magik to fight the Dwarves, as this new race was called, so made the Dwarves intensely resistant to both natural and unnatural damage. However, there seemed little reason to endow them with great mental powers; in fact, the limited intellect was seen as a benefit toward making the Dwarves single-minded of purpose. And the purpose the Faeries set the Dwarves to was to attack the Elves.</p>
      <p>Unsuspecting and with little defense from these vicious sub-creatures, the Elves in the early days of the struggle took vast losses. Having been crafted from magik, the Dwarves had some intrinsic stores of this energy that they quickly turned to achieving their task. They learned to sneak up on their much more aware adversaries by tunneling, and learned the artform of metallurgy to produce weapons.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: PRELUDE TO THE FIRST ELF-DWARF WAR</B></p>
      <p>At the time the war started, the Elves numbered some three hundred thousand broken into sixteen tribes. Of the original 160 High Ones that had come into The World, some 45 remained, the rest having transformed themselves into forms more capable of survival and unable or unwilling to return to their original forms.</p>
      <p>The Faeries had unleashed 32 Dwarves initially, and the Dwarves had spent their time multiplying, learning the art of metallurgy in order to produce tools and weapons, and discovering ways to slip in unnoticed on their much more sensitive foes. On the eve of the first battle, there were an estimated 1000 Dwarves armed with simple iron blades and skilled at tunneling.</p>
      <p>The battle of Turing Heights as it later became known was little more than a massacre. Having tunneled directly under the Skye Elves village, the Dwarves broke through the surface and butchered the unsuspecting, undefended and unprepared Tribe. The Skye Elves had been the largest Tribe, having had the most direct link to The First Tribe. Of the thirty thousand Elves in the Tribe, all but sixteen were slaughtered. More importantly, the 27 High Ones who were part of the Tribe were also killed. Not one Dwarf died. News of the massacre spread to the remaining Tribes nearly as fast as the confusion that resulted, for The Skye Tribe (later referred to as the Lost Tribe) had represented the undisputed leadership of the Elves.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE FIRST ELF-DWARF WAR</B></p>
      <p>When news of the massacre at Turing Heights reached the Faeries, their confusion was pronounced. &quot;What have we done?&quot; they asked The Elders. But The Elders had no answer to give and so the Faeries wept. Their Tears fell toward The World, and where the Tears struck the earth, lesser faeries - dryads, naiads, satyrs, pixies and nymphs sprang forth. Because the Tears were of sorrow, what sprang from the Tears would be eternally optimistic and happy. Because the Tears were shed by Faeries who would never forget their folly, their faerie offspring would be unable to remember a thing.</p>
      <p>It is also said that when the Dwarves saw their Faerie masters crying, they became enraged. &quot;Is this not what we were supposed to do?&quot; asked the Dwarves. &quot;Why do they weep for these Elves and cast us down?&quot; they wondered. The Dwarf leaders came to realize how little their Faerie creators respected them, and vowed never to follow their lead again. They cast off their name and became known as dwarves. At the same time, their single purpose of harassing the Elves changed into a general hatred for all things of the Faeries. The dwarves caught some of the Faerie Tears as they fell and planted them deep within their tunnels. Here the magik of The World metamorphosed the Tears into brilliant diamonds and other precious minerals. Because these substances reminded them of their betrayal and embarrassment, the dwarves sought these minerals out.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: AFTERMATH OF THE FIRST ELF-DWARF WAR</B></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Elves had problems of their own. &quot;High Ones&quot;, they said, turning to the leadership of their oldest members now that The Skye Elves had been lost, &quot;let us use our powers and purge this scourge that threatens us all!&quot; &quot;Destroy these vermin with your magik!&quot; they demanded.</p>
      <p><font color="#99ffcc">&quot;We came into The World to get away from our powers, not to use them whenever a problem presents itself.&quot;</font> countered the council of High Ones.<br>
      <font color="#99ffcc">&quot;If we resort to magik now then all that we have achieved is meaningless. We must meet this threat as we have all others - with our natural abilities. Let us instead train our own best to counter these dwarves and beat them at their own game.&quot;</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>And so the strongest and bravest Elf hunters left their Tribes and formed a new one. This New Tribe trained to defeat the dwarves, learning their ways and how to defeat them. They practiced in the art of war and learned to live and fight under the earth, that they could battle the dwarves on their own ground. And in time this New Tribe became known as the Drow and they became the defenders of the Elves.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE AGE OF REMORSE</B></p>
      <p>As the regret the Faeries felt over causing the death of their Elven kin ran its course, they began to think of how to undo their mistake. &quot;The dwarves have gone bad&quot; they said, &quot;We must defend our kin from these dwarves.&quot; &quot;The dwarves were a mistake; we will do better this time.&quot;</p>
      <p>And so, the Faeries set about creating a new race to act as defenders of the Elves. They gave their new creation as many of their own qualities as they could - great magikal power coupled with a solidarity of the group consciousness, for these they rationalized were their own greatest strengths. To this they added intense wisdom, for they assumed it would be needed to outwit the dwarves and to survive in The World. And lastly they inserted as much of the dwarven strength of character and constitution as they could muster. And this new creation they named Gnomes and charged them with the defense of their kin.</p>
      <p>But the Faeries had done too good a job of instilling wisdom in the Gnomes, for the Gnomes instantly realized the futility in taking sides. They opted the course of neutrality and set themselves to the task of multiplying and to surviving.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE AGE OF DECLINE</B></p>
      <p>The Faerie power had been waning since the Elves had departed. The creation of the Dwarves had weakened them still further and the ill-fated gnome project had depleted their reserves of Magik.</p>
      <p>Worse, The Elders now found themselves being second guessed and even doubted by the other Faeries. Factions began to spring up and the Elves were no longer the only dissenting Faerie group.</p>
      <p>The majority still remained true to the old ways, maintaining that the answer was to force repatriation upon the Elven renegades and their kin. But a sizable minority advocated a full break and that the Faeries would be better served by returning to the exploration of their magikal powers rather then dwelling on the Elven problem. There were even whispered rumors that some Faeries were even leaning toward the Elven doctrine and some even claimed that other Faeries had left to become Elves.</p>
      <p>It was with powers diminished, reserves depleted, dissent rampant and a lack of leadership that the Faeries entered the Second Great Age of The World. With the Faerie's in a state of confusion, decline and turned toward internal affairs, the dwarves, Elves and gnomes were now free to develop without influence.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE SECOND AGE OF THE WORLD</B></p>
      <p>While indeed there was tremendous potential for great advancement with the Faeries having left the scene, however temporarily, it was not realized chiefly because of the state of affairs The World had been left in by the Faeries.</p>
      <p>The Elves still followed the leadership of the Council of High Ones, but they too were in a state of confusion. The oldest Elves and all of the High Ones that were left still advocated remaining faithful to the original ideas and coexisting with the nature around them, yet the younger generations began to turn away from this pacifism as the toll of the dwarven raids continued to mount. More and more, the younger Elves looked to the Drow for guidance.</p>
      <p>At the same time, dwarven society, never strong on brain power to begin with, had centered on purging the faerie kin from The World. Mastering the art of metallurgy and weapon making had been but one step, learning to approach without detection via tunneling had been another. Yet their chief problem was also a lack of leadership, for no dwarf had yet distinguished himself as undisputed leader.</p>
      <p>The gnomes for their part, continued to remain aloof, although this was soon to change. Having developed a communal consciousness, leadership was a shared task and hence not a problem. They had turned their attention to exploring their own powers of magik.</p>

      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: PRELUDE TO THE BATTLE OF DEL'AL-MEIN</B></p>
      <p>Throughout the First Age, the skirmishing between the Drow defenders and the dwarven warriors had been rather low-key - little more than hit and fade or nuisance raids. Neither side seemed committed to a major engagement; the Elves because the Drow were largely untested and the dwarves because of their numerical inferiority. But as the dwarf prospered with each generation and as dwarven need for leadership became more pronounced, this was sure to change. The Battle of Del'Al-Mein is marked as not only the definitive battle of the second elf-dwarf war and as a large escalation in the violence between the two races but as the opening act of the Second Age as well.</p>
      <p>Five dwarven warlords, each vying for supremacy devised a plan whereby each would lead his followers in a massed attack on the Elven Council's enclave, whichever warlord distinguished himself the most, would be crowned Lord High Darmok of all the dwarven lands. Each warlord brought his forces in number and motivated his lieutenants to supreme achievement with offers of position within his Darmokship upon success.</p>
      <p>On the Elven side, the Drow had crafted a system of pit traps and snares around their encampments, and had numerous telltales to provide warning of undermining and tunneling in the region. They had a significant advantage in number, despite the dwarves large commitment, but their numbers were padded with many untrained youths and untested warriors. The youths, while untrained, held the Drow warriors in virtual adoration and were willing to do almost anything to win praise and recognition, something the Council of High Ones had taken note of and expressed some concern over.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE BATTLE OF DEL'AL-MEIN</B></p>
      <p>The battle itself was of little note, grand strategy and tactics being poorly defined and little understood at the time, it would be unfair to completely ignore the major actions, especially as the repercussions would be so far reaching into the future (cf. The Darmoks of the Second Age - Anilstathis) (cf. Secret Battles of the Drow - Anilstathis)</p>
      <p>Two warlords were to tunnel from opposite directions in a hope that one would avoid detection (this was common raiding doctrine). Regardless of their success, the remaining warlords would initiate a massed ground attack as soon as the alarms had been raised and Elven forces committed. It was hoped that with the Drow defense tied down by the tunneling groups, the ground forces would make short work of whatever was left.</p>
      <p>While simplistic and seemingly easy to execute, the plan began to fall apart almost from the beginning. One tunneling group hit bedrock, and was forced to redig in an alternate direction. Not realizing the other groups problem, the second tunneling group advanced steadily and triggered the Drow alarms right on schedule.</p>
      <p>The alarms themselves had been constructed too sensitively, and when one went off, they all triggered. Drow forces could not pin down where the attack was coming from and began rushing to all fronts at once.</p>
      <p>Thinking the Drow confusion denoted both tunneling groups arrival, the three ground units charged in a disorganized fashion lest one of the other warlords gain the prize first. Unfortunately, this rash advance led them smack into the midst of the pit traps and other hazards, and it was the dwarves who took the first casualties without a blow having been thrown.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE BATTLE OF DEL'AL-MEIN: part II</B></p>
      <p>Alarms blaring, cries of pain from the woods around them and a yet to be seen enemy force caused additional panic amongst the Drow. At that moment, the second tunnel group burst through the surface, and with a sense of timing that would gratify any general, the ground forces broke through the tree line and entered the Elven lines. The battle proper began.</p>
      <p>Drow numbers were just barely sufficient to make up for their lack of skill. Where the dwarves had been training for war, the Drow had been training for defense, and more specifically defense from a raid and not an army. In the initial waves, four Elves died for every dwarf that was struck down.</p>
      <p>Those Drow not assaulted by the initial waves saw their kin struck down mercilessly. Worse, a small group of dwarves had broken into the council area itself, and word spread that 4 High Ones had been slain before help arrived. Confusion turned to anger, and anger to hatred. Long dormant thoughts welled to the Faerie children's minds, and the rage of those Drow was unleashed in full fury! Their magikal powers, untouched for generations, came unbidden to their minds, and while it had been weakened by long disuse, it was more then sufficient to turn the tide of battle.</p>
      <p>Giant swirls of magik enveloped the attacking dwarves, and tore them asunder, destroying the invaders without mercy. Attacked by magik with which they could not hope to compete, there was no viable alternative for the dwarves but to sound a retreat.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE BATTLE OF DEL'AL-MEIN: aftermath</B></p>
      <p>On the dwarf side, fully 85% of the four warlord groups had been destroyed by the offensive magik. Three of the warlords lay dead, and a fourth had been struck a blow that left him unconscious (he would die some weeks later never having regained consciousness). The first tunnelling group led by Skandar GoldTooth that had hit bedrock had broken through sufficiently late in the attack to realize the tide of battle had turned, and Skandar had held the majority of his forces back while also organizing the general retreat. Being the only warlord left and more importantly, the only one with a sizable force at his command, Skandar GoldTooth was crowned first High Darmok of the dwarven peoples, and promptly led them away lest his retreat turn into a rout.</p>
      <p>The Elves for their part had suffered tremendously as well. A large number of Drow warriors had sacrificed themselves in the defense, worse, the untrained had been slaughtered and as they represented the young, were a terrible loss. Too, some nine of the High Ones had been killed in all, bringing their remaining numbers to six living. Despite the losses, the spirits and morale was high, and it was only by calling a Full Council that the High Ones stopped the remaining Drow from attacking the fleeing dwarves.</p>

      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE COUNCIL OF DEL'AL-MEIN</B></p>
      <p>With the dead still unburied, and the wounded still bleeding, the six High Ones called a full council. Tradition stated that a full council required every Elf to attend. But with the short notice, it was only those who had actually been at the fight. This became an important point, for only those Elves had witnessed how the battle had been won, would represent the council and its decrees to their own tribes when news later spread.</p>
      <p>For their part, The High Ones were outraged at the Drow's use of forbidden magik to achieve victory.</p>
      <p><font color="#99ffcc">&quot;WE LEFT THE WORLD TO DISCARD OUR POWERS!&quot;, they shouted, &quot;HOW DARE YOU USE THEM LIKE THIS?&quot;</font></p>
      <p>&quot;What were we to do, High Ones, let ourselves be butchered?&quot;, retorted the Drow.</p>
      <p><font color="#99ffcc">&quot;If need be, yes! To discard our principles at the least sign of troubles casts the entire foundation on which those principles are based upon into doubt. Your actions have in a single night, virtually annulled everything we sought to prove in coming here. What have you done?&quot;</font></p>
      <p>&quot;We did what you asked us to! DEFEND YOU!&quot;, cried the Drow indignantly.</p>
      <p>A long period of silence followed, each side realizing how far the other had drifted from their own way of thinking. Then the Drow leader spoke up himself.</p>
      <p>&quot;High Ones, these powers seem to be our best weapon in this fight, I wish to begin retraining my forces to best utilize them and...&quot;</p>
      <p><font color="#99ffcc">&quot;UNQUESTIONABLY, NO!&quot;</font> the High Council interrupted. <font color="#99ffcc">&quot;Under no circumstances will you contemplate using these powers now or in the future!&quot;</font></p>
      <p>&quot;High Ones, it is our only hope!&quot;</p>
      <p><font color="#99ffcc">&quot;NO!&quot;, returned the High Council adamantly.</font></p>
      <p>&quot;High Ones, you charged us to defend you, and to defend you we need to use all of our skills. You then say, we can not use some skills in that defense. I cannot see how to achieve the former, without utilizing the latter, and so, if I must, will provide for your defense in the best way I see fit without your blessings&quot;, proclaimed the Drow leader.</p>
      <p><font color="#ffccff">&quot;You Drow are unworthy of our blessings if you toss aside all that we hold sacred. GO! Take what you need from us and never again set foot within our circle.&quot;</font>, The High Council leader commanded. <font color="#ffccff">&quot;All that follow you are unworthy to bear the Elf name, you have slipped beneath us and shall henceforth be called elves betokening your lower station on this World.&quot;</font><br>
      </p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: EFFECTS OF THE COUNCIL</B></p>
      <p>What the Council had failed to foresee was the extent to which the common Elf would side with the feelings the drow had expressed. The pacifistic attitudes of the Council seemed antiquated to meet the challenges of the new world and its enemies. And worse, the Council seemed unwilling to adapt, preferring, it seemed, death. Elves returning to their own tribe following the council meeting spoke disparagingly of the High One's decision, and the fact that so many had died defending the High One's idealistic way of life added insult to injury. The younger generations that had been told tales of the Faeries and the Elves early days upon The World as if they were utter nonsense were the least willing to subscribe to the High One's idealistic notions.</p>
      <p>As generation upon generation went by, and the depredations of the dwarves resumed and increased, fewer and fewer associated themselves with the flawed Elven ideals and associated themselves (and their tribe) with the drow. Within ten generations, not one major tribe still retained the Elf name, having been forced to deal with The World's realities and respond as elves would - using any power or advantage they could.</p>
      <p>During the same time, elven society flourished and prospered. Elven tribes scattered across The World and took up residence in distant, and sometime harsh, climates. Tribes took on the names of the landscape in which they made their home. No longer did they consider themselves one people, as the different tribes took on different attitudes to meet the challenges they faced. As Sea elves needed a different approach to obtaining food than the Plains elves or Wood elves adapted, so each tribe cultivated its own traditions, culture, and ultimately dialect and language.</p>
      <p>The dwarves, for their part licked their wounds awhile, but had salvaged the better part of valor. As the elven tribes spread, the dwarf raiders followed - taking up residence in nearby hills, mountains or whatever suited their fancy. Their culture too began to fragment as mountain dwarves learned how to process a different sort of ore than their hill dwarf cousins. Skandar GoldTooth and those that followed him as High Darmok remembered what happened at Del'Al-Mein though, and refused to allow an internal squabble to threaten the grand purpose of the dwarven race. Whenever a major new metallurgical process was discovered, the Darmoks made sure all branches of the rapidly splintering dwarf race became aware of it. No dwarf worth his gold would fail to know at least the basics of metal processing and weapon making. And what were basics to a dwarf, became the advanced skills other races aspired to.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE GNOMES</B></p>
      <p>As elves and dwarves spread across The World, fragmenting their society into individual branches in the process, the gnomes watched. Their own society grew at a rapid pace, as it was a group effort to advance. While not as diverse as the other two races, their skills and commitment to their community goals made them a force to be reckoned with.</p>
      <p>The Faeries had instilled in the gnomes a strong sense of preservation for the elves. Too, they had given them a sense of wisdom, and it was this that had caused the initial gnomes to realize that not only was it the elves who were the Faerie's children, but also the dwarves as well as themselves. Having been directed to preserve the Faerie kin, they had set about how best to accomplish this, using their own unique definitions.</p>
      <p>The gnome leaders had concluded that the elf-dwarf conflict had to be terminated in order for either of those races to progress. They also perceived that the reason the conflict had gone on for so long was that both sides had an adequate feeling of safety from natural threats, thus leisure time was spent in waging war. Hence they set out to create a few more natural threats that would require both races to worry about.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE GNOME EXPERIMENTS</B></p>
      <p>While the logic driving the experiments was somewhat convoluted, the gnomes used amazing powers of research in achieving their goals. They determined that if The World was a dangerous place, elves and dwarves would need to worry about defense more, and offense less. Less offense would translate into a smaller (or hopefully non-existent) war. In time, the war might be forgotten and the two races might come to cooperate against the new challenges.</p>
      <p>Their initial experiments caused them to unknowingly duplicate the Faerie's research that had led to the creation of the dwarves and later the gnomes themselves. They set about to create a new race or group of races whose main purpose was to bring about chaos and unleash misery. The proceedings of these experiments are detailed in a separate volume that they not clutter these discussions (cf. Discourse on the Gnome Experiments and Treatise on Life Creation - Anilstathis).</p>
      <p>From these experiments, gnomes learned the focus and control of magical energies necessary to achieve their ends. In underground labs they mingled thaumaturgy with simple rodents and grew their first race, the orcs. From there, they proceeded to goblins, kobolds and hobgoblins. Larger experiments resulted in the trolls and ogres. And the ultimate experiment started with a lizard as the base, and produced basilisk and finally the first small dragons. All were released upon The World, in order to see which would thrive.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE HOBBITS</B></p>
      <p>The gnome's first experiment called for 20 new breeds, for it was not known which would survive. But it was not long before one bright gnome realized that each of these new breeds could be cross bred to produce hundreds of permutations and combine the best traits of each. This simple modification not only guaranteed the experiment's success, for there was now a much broader range of genetic material to work from in later generations, but it brought about the need for the fourth major race of civilization.</p>
      <p>Quickly realizing that dealing with hundreds of new breeds instead of the handful they had started with was a tremendous task, the gnomes made a fateful decision to create a race of helpers capable of handling simple jobs in order to allow the gnomes to concentrate more thoroughly on their experiment. The gnomes mixed their own race's genes with that of their best experimental breed and installed the directive 'take orders, assist and obey'. With that, the first hobbits came into being.</p>
      <p>The first hobbits were something of a disappointment. They had been mixed from a concoction of bear cub, mouse and gnome gene, but the combination of the rodent's small brain with the poor intellectual development of a bear cub resulted in a simpleminded creature. Worse still, the directive of their gnome creators had become corrupted by the lack of mental facilities in the first hobbits. Later studies showed the first hobbits could only understand the first word of the directive.</p>
      <p>While further revisions of the initial design were tried, none proved to have the diligence the gnomes had hoped for. The hobbits directive had turned into a need to pilfer anything and everything the gnomes left around. As helpers, the hobbits were worthless; too often the directions were beyond the hobbits ability to understand. Or, if they did understand, unsupervised hobbits had an inclination to get themselves into predicaments. Their sole benefit was an instinctual knowledge of farming and agriculture which not even the chief gnome experimenter could explain. By the experiments end, the gnomes deemed it best to release their hobbit assistants with the other creations and let them fend for themselves; not one gnome wanted to take credit or responsibility for taking care of the hobbits.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE AGE OF REBALANCE</B></p>
      <p>And so it came to pass that the gnomes released their creations upon The World and retreated to their warrens to watch how things progressed. Many of their creatures proved unable to survive, a few others were unstable and broke into unexpected sub-creations. But a good portion of what was conceived survived and began to thrive.</p>
      <p>Each new race found its own niche in nature and as the dwarves, hobbits, gnomes and elves continued to spread, they quickly came into contact and conflict with the new creatures. Generations would pass and while the dwarf - elf conflict still flared from time to time, for the most part they and the other major races were content to just get on with life and push back the wilderness.</p>
      <p>In this, the gnomes celebrated their success. For they had succeeded in de-escalating the faerie-kin conflict by causing the two races to worry more about the creatures around them, then the distant enemy.</p>
      <p>Within a few dozen generations, the landscape had settled into a loose, new equilibrium. Every nook and cranny was populated with some sort of creature, thriving and competing with its neighbors for dominance or survival. But it would not be long before something else would appear to disturb the balance.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE HUMAN SCOURGE</B></p>
      <p>No one is exactly sure where the humans came from. According to some, they resulted from some bizarre cross breeding that characterized the early years of the gnome experiment. Ryure Bloodaxe, Darmok of the dwarves at the time of the humans arrival insisted to his dying day that the humans were the result of elven magic upon a hobbit, for humans combined the annoying nature of the furfoots with the aggressiveness of drow enchantments. Hobbits of course never liked this characterization, and have even been known to give away or discard something if it is discovered to have belonged to Ryure. Gnome scholars are said to have conducted some studies into human heritage, but the results were never revealed and one of the easiest ways to upset a gnome is to ask questions about where the results are or what they might contain. Some have even theorized that humans were yet another product of Faerie magik, but most who have advanced this theory are usually thought crazy unless they qualify the statement as Faerie magik gone completely bad.</p>
      <p>Regardless of their origins, what is not disputed is that they quickly became a force to be reckoned with on The World. Drifting from some area to the south, the humans spread into the civilized lands, quickly adapting to whatever terrain and problems they encountered. Breeding at a much faster race then any of the faerie kin, it was clear that within a few dozen centuries humans would outnumber the other Four Races combined.</p>
      <p>The greatest threat though was that these early humans seemed to bear no sense of responsibility or long term planning. Perhaps it was due to their short life spans that they did not concern themselves with the repercussions of what they did. Nevertheless, the humans represented not only a threat to the equilibrium, but the potential for annihilation for everyone. This fact was not lost on the Four Races, and what they would do about it was to have important repercussions in later years.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE FAERIE KIN CONFERENCE</B></p>
      <p>The early humans represented the single biggest threat to any of the other faerie races. More adaptive then any of them and with designs on areas long held as being ancestral homes of the Four Races, they represented a sizable threat to each of them. Worse, humans were relatively short lived so that within a few hundred years they would outnumber the faeriekin. Their short lives also made their logical reasoning suspect, and past interactions with them had proven that they were distrustful of non-humans, regarding everyone else as an animal.</p>
      <p>Gnomes were most cognizant of the potential for disaster this represented. Worse, something they had discovered in their human-research inspired a great fear in them. Something had to be done to avoid this problem before it destroyed all of them. And so, gnome envoys went to enclaves of the Four Races to request a representative for a conference.</p>
      <p>Much time was spent just in choosing a location for this event, and even more time in establishing protocols, for there was still much distrust amongst the various races, and no one wanted to be seen as less than equal. In the end, the conference was established as a non-voting body who would hear ideas from each of the Four Races on possible solutions. What each race would do with those ideas was up to them.</p>
      <p>When the delegations finally sat down, it was the first time a member from each of the Four Races had been present in one place at one time. The fact that the majority of each delegations was nothing more than an armed guard betokens the distrust, but the fact that they came at all speaks of the threat they perceived in the humans. Much of the transcript of that meeting involves racial insults and face saving arguments, but by the end of the third day, a consensus of action had been reached. It would require another 5 days to fully hash out but the resulting idea was to yet again change the very nature of The World.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE SOLUTION OF SHERCADIA</B></p>
      <p>The results of the first Faeriekin conference at Shercadia were profound. Beset by a potential enemy that would consume them all, the Four Races hit upon a plan not to fight the humans, but instead to alter the situation sufficiently that the problem could be managed or at least contained.</p>
      <p>The initial proposal made by Gunderi, chief council for the gnomes, was to subvert the very structure of the human's being. Gunderi revealed that the gnome studies had found that the human makeup could be manipulated by them, although he was careful to avoid bringing up the issue of how gnomes had developed this gnowledge nor what else gnomes gnew about humankind. With that formality out of the way he proposed that humans be subverted, altering their genetic makeup so as to make them less dangerous.</p>
      <p>The final proposal was to graft together the best quality of each race into a human testbed in the hopes that the final product would not only be superior to the existing humans, thus supplanting them, but also more similar to Four Races that they might be able to reap the benefits of such a cross matching, for each race coveted humans for their adaptability.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE SHERCADIAN PLAN</B></p>
      <p>It took a full year from the end of the conference of Shercadia until each race had agreed to this bizarre plan. In the end, it was agreed that a human race bonded with the responsible genetics of the faeriekin would be not only less a threat, but better able to be exploited. The literature that remains from this era shows signs that each race hoped to use the neo-humans for their own purposes, and discussed them mostly in terms of slaves or at best, subject vassals. While history would prove the humans would vastly improve the civilized races, the patronizing attitudes the Four Races had for humans would later come back to haunt them, but that is a tale for another time.</p>
      <p>And so it came to pass that each race sent members to the gnomelands to be utilized in the plan. The elven ambassador offered her intellect and love of The World, the dwarves their steadfast dedication to the goal at hand, and the hobbits offered their curiosity and inquisitiveness. To this, the gnomes bonded their own wise nature.</p>
      <p>It was introduced into humanity according to the plan and quickly achieved its desired effect. For the neo-humans were indeed superior to their barbaric cousins and in addition, bore the traits they had been gifted from the gnome technicians.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE NEO-HUMANS</B></p>
      <p>Within six generations the neo-humans had all but taken over the leadership of human kind, they were that far superior. In another 8 generations, it was near impossible to find a non neo-human, for the blood lines of each major lineage had intermingled itself sufficiently with that of the hybrids that the original humans were on the way to extinction.</p>
      <p>Still more generations went by and the neo-humans were the sole survivors. But the fallout of the Shercadian plan had yet to begin. Each race likes to blame the problems that were created on the traits of the other, while taking credit for the benefits, and there are certainly enough problems and benefits to go around. For you see, the humans were highly efficient at exploiting the gifts the races had given them.</p>
      <p>In the early years, while the Four Races were trying to exploit the neo-humans, they were in turn being exploited for the knowledge they possessed. Metal lore, innovation and craftsmanship, farming and agriculture and magic all passed from its original masters into the hands of humanity. As time went by, these skills were broadened and intermingled. While the Four Races remained the experts in their fields, humanity kept up as close seconds in all areas.</p>
      <p>The close of the Second Age of The World would see each of the Four Races stabilized upon The World. The Faeries had completely faded from the scene, and more pressing concerns had caused them to be all but forgotten. A precarious peace existed where each race was more concerned with its own survival then the destruction of its enemies. And perhaps as an indicator of things to come, the humans were gradually closing the gap between their knowledge and those of the Four Races.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE THIRD AGE OF THE WORLD</B></p>
      <p>Throughout the Second Age, human society had been modeled upon that of the Four Races. Their were tribe-like communities that were mostly territorial and predominantly tied to a certain type of terrain for survival. They formed above group dwellings like the elves and except for the occasional meeting between some members of humanity and the Four Races, there was little contact. The Coronation of Emperor Spirt would not only change human society, but would herald the beginning of the Third Age.</p>
      <p>Up until this time, each human enclave had a local ruler and the individual enclaves were not likely to mix much except for the occasional marriages or other special events. While the gnomes had one grand leader, they were much too communal to think in terms of all owing allegiance to one person. The dwarves had a Darmok, but not since the days following Del'Al-mein had this title been undisputed. So when the human races crowned Spirt Emperor of all Humanity, it was a momentous event.</p>
      <p>The exact reasons for his coronation are best left as a separate volume, but the immediate results of it can not be so lightly dismissed. (cf. The Ignoble Rise to Power of Emperor Spirt and the Shame of The First Human Dynasty - Anilstathis) In his 10 initial directives, Spirt ordered each human enclave to establish and maintain regular contact with the 3 closest other enclaves. Additionally, he ordered that the product of one enclave be made available to those it had contact with in a fair exchange. The construction of traversable paths between enclaves was also ordered. In short, Spirt laid down the construction of civilization itself, and at the time this was a unique idea.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE DIRECTIVES OF EMPEROR SPIRT</B></p>
      <p>And it came to pass that each of the 10 directives was carried out. The human enclaves began communication and trade one with each other. At the same time, the Four Races remained as isolated holdings shielded from contact with each other by their mistrust and ancient hatreds. As the years passed, knowledge that one human group had obtained from the Four Races was passed throughout humanity. Innovations that one person devised were transmitted around and advancement jumped by incredible amounts. In the 39 years of Spirt's rule, the gap between human knowledge and that of the Four Races was cut by 3/4ths.</p>
      <p>The son of Spirt, his daughter (Spirt's granddaughter) and her son would follow as Emperor's themselves before the first human dynasty was to collapse and the Emperorship of humanity left vacant. But in that short time, humans rose from a distant, ignorant, backwater race into a civilized society.</p>
      <p>The power of civilization had not been lost on the Four Races. Meager attempts were made to duplicate it, but most met with failure or wound up as pale shadows of what humanity had achieved. Ultimately, the Four Races were forced to plead to be included in the civilization humanity had achieved. Humanity was of course happy to oblige, for each addition brought increased trade opportunities, but brought about new inroads into the faeriekin knowledge that remained secret. And as time went by, it ceased to be Four Races and humanity, but instead became the civilized peoples and the civilized lands.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE THIRD ELF - DWARF WAR</B></p>
      <p>That is not to say that all was peaceful and good in The World. Civilization required increasing amounts of contact between the diverse groups. Hatreds millennium old slowly but surely came back to the surface. And worse, these old insults were compounded by perceived slights when trade deals didn't prove to be as profitable as originally thought. Civilization was a two-edged sword. It brought about great advancements but required increased contact with others to achieve it. There was a dark side to this contact that would boil over.</p>
      <p>The racial skirmishes of old had gradually turned into small raids on each others trade. Then slowly they became attacks on anyone trying to trade with the enemy. Next came the trade sanctions various enclaves set up. Entire villages refused to accept the products of other races villages or even deal fairly with them. Complicating the matters, they would set up double standards on goods for those that refused to support them. Human traders increasingly found themselves asked if they carried elven wares when entering dwarven villages. Those that answered yes often found themselves unwelcome or offered uncompetitive prices. Elves reciprocated and a bitter trade war commenced.</p>
      <p>Caravans were destroyed, trade routes laid waste and entire regions cut off in vicious sieges. Parties that had had no interest in the war found themselves caught up in it by association with one member or another. Worse still, the conflict spawned intraracial strife as allies of one side found other villages allied to the other side.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: RESULTS OF THE THIRD ELF-DWARF WAR</B></p>
      <p>A handful of achievements were realized during this war though. The art of warfare of course advanced immensely. Dwarven metal lore and eleven magics were pushed to their limits and many useful developments in these areas were realized. Hobbits profited greatly during this period, selling their foods to regions laid waste by war.</p>
      <p>At the same time, gnomes found themselves in a difficult position. They felt morally bound to end the bloodshed, but to do so they needed to achieve the respect of both sides. Using typically convoluted gnomish logic, they set about to stop the war by creating better weapons. The weapons would be given to one side or the other to earn the gratitude of that group, and it was hoped that they could parley this gratitude into influence and the influence into a means to end the war. Strangely enough, it worked, but much blood was shed by these fantastic weapons and the existence of these items remains a blot on the collective minds of every gnome.</p>
      <p>A handful of these items survive today, being much treasured for their destructive capabilities. But for every true device, a dozen cheap imitations are sold by fake peddlers in antiquities. And of course many of these weapons were destroyed during the war or obliterated by the gnomes as a step of penance later on.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: AFTERMATH OF THE THIRD ELF - DWARF WAR</B></p>
      <p>With no human emperor to maintain solidarity amongst the humans, the various villages had foolishly taken sides in the conflict. The result was that they frequently found themselves on opposite sides of the battlefield. The war itself had a large number of battles with accompanying bloodshed and tragedy, but the fine points of which are best left to a military textbook rather then this general discourse.</p>
      <p>It is sufficient to state that these battles created regional strife as one town grew to hate the neighboring town for their role in such-and-such a battle. And of course this was reciprocated. Humanity begin to fragment and the once mighty civilization it had created became nothing more then small pockets of allied towns and villages weakly imitating what once had been a global effort.</p>
      <p>An uneasy and somewhat false peace settled over the civilized lands. No longer was it one united body, but instead a conglomeration of smaller political units loosely affiliated similarly to the alliances formed during the war. The occasional raid and attack still occurred, and reprisals still happened. Travel was restricted, trade was minimal and foreigners were suspect.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE BLACK AGE</B></p>
      <p>With trade restricted, the pockets of civilization sought outlets for their products that had been unutilized as of yet. The answer they came up with was the semi-peaceful groups on the outskirts of society. Small trading bands began to deal with the kobolds, goblins and ogres.</p>
      <p>At first, the traders offered finished goods in exchange for laborers and guards. This often proved a risky venture as more traders then one found himself enslaved and his goods confiscated. But a successful venture often proved profitable as even the weakest ogre was the equal of a brawny human male, and the stamina they had exceeded even a dwarves. The demi-humans (orcs and the like) became cheap sources of labor. The demi-humans profited from the finished products that civilization supplied them with, and they usually had more members then they could feed anywise, so getting rid of their excess to the civilized lands was doubly a benefit.</p>
      <p>It wasn't long though before the demi-humans realized a better way to take advantage of the situation. For while the pockets of civilization often refused to deal with one another directly, almost all of them were trading with the demi-humans. Rather then being the outlets for trade, demihumans became the middlemen keeping trade across the entire society flowing. Not to say that the demihumans were either fair or civilized about it. Great profiteering occurred on the part of the demihumans and frequently less wary tradesman were never heard from again.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE END OF THE THIRD AGE OF THE WORLD</B></p>
      <p>More than a hands-breadth of centuries would pass with the status quo becoming increasingly entrenched. Some progress occurred to say the least, but for the most part, civilization had become profoundly stagnant. Worse, it was being raped of its useful products by sub creatures that should never have seen the light of day.</p>
      <p>The Third Age is most notable for the establishment of civilization. And while this civilization proved less glorious then was possible, it was nonetheless a tremendous advancement over the marginally nomadic existence the enclaves had used during the Second Age.</p>
      <p>It is also of note that the five civilized races began to cooperate one with each other (excepting elves and dwarves). Where once it was unheard of for members of three separate races to be in one place, by the close it was so common place as to be unnoticeable.</p>
      <p>Lastly, it is during the Third Age that humanity came into its own as an equal. The development of civilization went a long way towards achieving this, but there are numerous and unmentioned cases where humanity led the way during the Third Age.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE RETURN OF THE FAERIES</B></p>
      <p>Although long forgotten, the Faeries had not forgotten their departed kin on The World. They too had gone through a cataclysmic period far separated from those we have described. A overly simplistic treatment would categorize what had befallen the Faeries as a civil war regarding how to handle the Elf situation. This is a rather poor choice of words, for the concept of violence was unpalatable to a race that lived for Eons upon Eons. Likewise, any combat between creatures who molded reality as quickly and perfectly as thought allowed would be rather short. In truth, what had happened was something close to a moral debate with the prize being leadership of the Council of Elders.</p>
      <p>Indeed, a great rift occurred amongst the Faeries at the time when civilization was deep in the morass of the Black Age. The old Elders had lost the debate long ago, so the decision was not over whether interference should occur, it was over what form the interference should be of.</p>
      <p>And when the debate was concluded and the Faeries once again of one mind, they set the final plan into action. Their magical reserves had grown back somewhat in the 15 millenniums since unleashing the Dwarves. With the stalemate The World was in, the time was ripe for the Faeries to reestablish their presence, and so the Fourth Age of The World began.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE AGE OF INTERFERENCE</B></p>
      <p>Of the Faerie groups that had participated in the great debate, none were stronger than those led on one side by Logrus and on the other by Galek. Two of the most powerful Faeries, they could not agree on what form the interference should be to solve the Elf question.</p>
      <p>Logrus on one side advocated the older policies of making The World inhospitable. At some point when things looked bleakest, he would then offer them a way back to the paradise of home. His plan required the least effort, for the five civilized races had done an exceptional job of creating chaos.</p>
      <p>On the other side was Galek. His biggest problem with Logrus's ideas was in the unnecessary bloodshed that would be required. He instead supported restoring knowledge of what Faerie life was like in the hopes that that alone would be enough for them to want to return.</p>
      <p>Logrus wished to create havoc until there was no choice but to return. Galek maintained that the return was by no means a sure thing. As Faerie Magik's strength was tied to the condition of The World, Galek reasoned it best to heal the planet rather then bring harm to it.</p>
      <p>In the end, neither Galek nor Logrus won. For it was decided by the body of Faeries that neither course was guaranteed success, and they opted to give both methods a chance, to see which would bring about a greater result. And so, Galek and Logrus became the first Faeries to enter The World since the release of the Dwarves.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE ARRIVAL OF LOGRUS</B></p>
      <p>Logrus appeared in the lands on the eastern extreme of civilization. For his plan to work, he had to make life as miserable as possible for those around him, and yet seem to offer a means of escape. That means was of course a return to the Faeries home.</p>
      <p>He chose a point on the edge of society, relatively untouched by the centuries of war. While the groups in this area had their disagreements with each other, they also were not fenced in with neighbors all around, as they were on the frontier. A natural outlet for aggression and expansion presented itself to these groups, and this kept the area rather stable and peaceful. And it was this peace that Logrus wished to destroy.</p>
      <p>Logrus's first task was to shut down the borders, so that the region would slowly feel more constrained and turn in upon itself. For this task, he turned to the demihumans. The demihuman tribes had long been trading with the civilized creatures, but had never taken full advantage of the situation. Traders freely exchanged arms and weapons with these groups, and the demihumans had more often then not used these items in their clan battles for internal dominance. Had the demihumans ever turned those weapons outward at the command of a leader, Logrus realized he could threaten the entire structure and fabric of civilization.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: LOGRUS'S PLAN</B></p>
      <p>Now Logrus was a Faerie, and as such, was an undisputed master of magik. And thus it was rather simple for him to make some sweeping changes in how the demihumans structured themselves.</p>
      <p>His first task was to raise his greatest asset, the ogres, up from mindlessness. Into them he instilled the beginnings of sentience. And into the best of these, he added a knowledge of magik - thus creating the first of the ogre-magi's. These ogres and ogre magi's he set in charge over all the lesser demihumans. And so it is today, that orcs, kobolds and goblins of all sorts look to ogres for leadership.</p>
      <p>The ogres though were still lacking in wit. So, from a pool of hatred deep within The World that predated even Logrus, he congealed the first Daemons, and these he set as masters over the ogres.</p>
      <p>With his minions in place, Logrus set them loose upon the civilized lands and moved on to bigger things.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE CRIME LORDS</B></p>
      <p>With the demihumans beginning to wreak havoc upon civilization, Logrus made his first appearance amongst the civilized races. While he concealed his Faerie heritage, he quickly became regarded as a powerful magician, for the art of magic was mere child's play for one used to controlling raw and unbridled magik.</p>
      <p>Logrus's arrival was at a time when civilization was at its bleakest. Torn by centuries of strife and feeding on itself intentionally, Logrus found his task simple. He quickly pointed out the new threat the demihumans posed and played upon this fear to cause panic amongst the citizens. And when possible, Logrus used the long standing hatreds as a basis for inducing paranoia regarding enemies and friends alike.</p>
      <p>As the enclaves descended further into fear and terror, the various leaders began to arm themselves against the demihumans. Anyone with a blade and knowledge of how to use it could find a place in the militias that were being built. And as one enclave developed a militia, this induced fear in their neighbors, forcing them to make their own militias. The first would feel justified in the construction of their original militia, but scared by the arming of their neighbors, and so would build additional militias.</p>
      <p>The militias required constant training, and so it came to happen that if there was no local war, they often turned to acting as guards for the local caravans or returned to the task of trade raiding, but now as a military unit. Quickly the roads became unsafe, as bored militias lurked waiting to overtake the common traveler at the instant vigilance was lost.</p>
      <p>The expense of keeping these militias in the field was also costly, areas often neglected to pay them in a timely fashion, allowing them to keep what booty they could capture. More often then not, the militias began to capture booty not from the enemy, but from those they had been designed to defend. The worst offenders of this practice became known as the Crime Lords.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE TEACHINGS OF LOGRUS</B></p>
      <p>Hysteria, paranoia, fear and hate were the hallmark of Logrus's motions. But while the effects were rather clear to the outsider, Logrus's arguments always made perfect sense as a way to turn around what he was secretly trying to bring about. As the Crime Lords began to hold sway, Logrus again offered a solution.</p>
      <p>His teachings began to turn themselves to how to maintain a true and lasting peace. His logic stated the best bet was to tie oneself to a strong leader able to keep less strong enemies away. This leader would have lieutenants able to maintain regional control in the leader's absence, and the lieutenants in turn would need sergeants and so forth. The entire hierarchy was protected from any threat that its leader could defeat, and of course the leader had the massed strength of the entire hierarchy beneath him at his command. Thus a commoner could ally himself to a simple gang leader, turning over a modest amount of his produce for protection. The gang leader in turn would ally himself to a local garrison to defeat anything bigger then the gang could handle. The garrison allies itself to the army and the army follows a leader.</p>
      <p>Implicit in these teachings though was the fact that the leaders at each step must be stronger then those under them. A weak leader would be unable to defend against exterior enemies, and this threatened the entire hierarchy. Similarly, a follower unable to provide their leader with increased capability was worthless. Thus while a leader has command over all beneath him, he is responsible for culling the weak from the chain. Strength though is not just strength of arms, it is best defined as utility provided to the leader. So a farmer providing food to the leader is offering a positive utility and should be maintained. The leader is responsible for insuring that all his followers are providing a benefit, for a follower that is not, is making the leader less capable. And a less capable leader threatens the safety of all.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE CULT OF LOGRUS</B></p>
      <p>As Logrus's teachings spread, and came into practice, his followers became known as the Cult of Logrus. True to his words, Logrus managed the early Cult with an iron hand, and required all his leaders to do likewise. Discipline was strict from Logrus on down to the most common dragoon at the bottom of the chain. But slowly they began to turn the tide against both the demihuman and Crime Lord aggressors.</p>
      <p>Logrus instituted a system of rules of conduct to be followed by his sub leaders, as well as a mantra of expectations that any follower was expected to bring about for his leader. He set high standards, but by his words, the dangerous times demanded it. Justice was summary and swift. Failure from a follower was intolerable to a leader, such people were commonly made to serve side by side with the captured enemies made into slave labor. A harsh and disciplined peace was established.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE ARRIVAL OF GALEK</B></p>
      <p>Galek arrived into The World near the time that the Cult was beginning to take hold. What Logrus left unsaid in his teachings was just how bad life was for the common man under the Cult's thumb. Those not a part of the Cult could be persecuted by any member of the hierarchy with impunity, but joining was equivalent to accepting an oppressive yoke of what was due to your leader. This was the message of Galek and it was well received in certain areas.</p>
      <p>Galek preached personal responsibility and the inherent worth of the individual. While he admitted many problems were beyond the means of one person to overcome, subjugating another to your will was unacceptable. Cooperation in the face of adversity was the greatest virtue. And his chief tenant was respect for another's wishes, that they might respect yours. The missionaries of Galek spread this word far and wide, and wherever the missionaries went, the Guardians of the Steps, a force of trained paladins dedicated to Galek, were there to defend them.</p>
      <p>As Logrus's word appealed to the ego of a leader strong enough to have many followers, Galek's philosophies swayed the passions of the vast multitudes that would be forced to the bottom of Logrus's hierarchy.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE SPREAD OF TEACHINGS</B></p>
      <p>The spread of the teachings took three generations to bring about from one end of civilization to the other, fortunately Logrus and Galek were virtually immortal as Faeries. Even though the disciples might die, the teacher was always there. Logrus and Galek each spent much time amongst the nonhumans indirectly offering them a return to the Faerie realm, but their message achieved its greatest success amongst the humans, to the chagrin of both Faeries.</p>
      <p>As the generations passed, the teachings became institutions in themselves. Ultimately, the ancient hatreds Logrus had been praying upon became less a concern then the brewing conflict caused by the competing viewpoints. The Cult had long ago taken hold in neighboring regions separated by the Black Age, and with a common ground between the two groups established, it was only a matter of time before the barriers would drop. Where the Cult did not hold sway, Galek's teachings preached cooperation so these barriers dropped too, only to be replaced by defenses against the threat the opposing philosophy presented. It was only a matter of time before it would induce conflict.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE SLAVE REVOLTS AT FRARIN FALLS</B></p>
      <p>To the Galekians, the most distressing practice the Cult practiced was the use of slave labor. It was completely antithetical to teachings dedicated to the worth of every individual. On the Cult side, the only use for a failed follower or a defeated enemy was as a slave. And so, when a minor slave uprising occurred near the falls at Frarin, the stage was set for conflict.</p>
      <p>For years, the Cult had used vast numbers of Tytan laborers (cyclops, trolls, minotaurs, etc) to do the heavy work required to mine the area for its deposits of argentium and athanor. It was strenuous labor, the lifespan of even the most hardy of Tytan was measured in years, while few humans condemned here survived to see another birthday. Tytan's had served here since the earliest days of the Cult when they had been enslaved en masse for Logrus's personal use when they proved unusable as a demihuman threat.</p>
      <p>When an escapee made it to the paladin hold at Rursak and requested aid, claiming a revolt was in progress, the Galekians had all the excuse they needed. Fourteen legions marched on the measly garrison maintained at Frarin. As the paladins approached the defenders, they realized no revolt was occurring, but as the Tytans saw the paladins, their spirits jumped and a revolt was soon brought about. Seizing this opportunity, the paladins rode to the aid of the Tytans and succeeded in the rescue. Fully fifteen thousand Tytans were freed that day, and the debt they feel they owe the Galekians continues to this day. &quot;Remember Frarin&quot; being words no Tytan can ignore.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: AFTERMATH OF FRARIN FALLS</B></p>
      <p>As the word of either the treachery or success (depending on which side the messenger was on) spread, the flames of passion ignited. By weeks end, three dozen skirmishes had been fought and hundreds lay dying on battlefields around the countryside. As news of the various skirmishes trickled in, they served to incite increasing amounts of anger.</p>
      <p>Galek and Logrus themselves came under persecution. As the weeks went by and the war erupted fully around them, the two Faeries were increasingly called upon to aid their disciples through the use of magik. The refusal of such requests (for how could a Faerie bring himself to directly harm another faeriekin) began to cause a disillusionment amongst the disciples. The leadership of both factions was being openly questioned and neither Faerie knew how to proceed. And so it was decided that Galek and Logrus would meet upon a neutral plain near the center of The World.</p>
      <p><b>General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to: THE MEETING OF GALEK AND LOGRUS</B></p>
      <p>Galek was appalled at the recent events. His teachings of peaceful coexistence had backfired dramatically, instead bringing about a major war that seemed certain to devastate rather than save The World. He was fully ready to concede defeat to Logrus at the meeting, and this Logrus knew.</p>
      <p>But it was Logrus that spoke first as the two Faeries met. <font color="#99ccff">&quot;I have failed, you know&quot;</font>, he began.</p>
      <p><font color="#ffff99">&quot;Failed? How better to achieve your ends than through a war? You have succeeded far better than I.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#99ccff">&quot;Have I?&quot;</font> countered Logrus,<font color="#99ccff"> &quot;Look about you. It was not about causing a war, it was about returning the inhabitants of this realm to our own. It has been 132 years since I last set foot on our own plane, and in all that time how many lostkin have agreed to come home? I can count on one hand the number of lostkin who even admit to accepting the idea that they did not originate here, and not one of them was willing to return.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffff99">&quot;Aye, my own results in that matter have been equally as depressing.&quot;</font> bemoaned Galek.</p>
      <p><font color="#99ccff">&quot;So what are we to do friend Galek?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffff99">&quot;What can we do? Staying here will cost us all that we have gained. My followers are beginning to doubt me, I fear it will not be long before my influence is lost.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#99ccff">&quot;Yes, my own lieutenants are already speaking of revolution to replace me. I think it is time to leave The World. Perhaps when what we have started here has run its course, a few more of the lostkin will be better able to accept what we offer them.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffff99">&quot;This conflict will run for many years you realize?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#99ccff">&quot;You forget I too am Faerie. Of course I realize this brother Galek. But if there is anything left of our kins Faerie self, it will flee from this madness and seek us out.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffff99">&quot;Or seek to change things.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#99ccff">&quot;I believe we've had this debate before.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffff99">&quot;Yes, it does sound familiar. I make you this promise friend Logrus, you watch for lostkin seeking an escape, and I will keep an eye out for those seeking changes. Those that do so without our presence are most likely to be open to an offer home.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#99ccff">&quot;Agreed&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffff99">&quot;I believe we can leave things as they are. What we have started has no end in sight.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#99ccff">&quot;Not quite. Your Galekians may be used to cooperation, but I am afraid my own forces would descend into civil war unless there is a strong leader at its head.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffff99">&quot;You plan on staying? What are you saying?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#99ccff">&quot;Not at all. This World has too much regret for me to stay, I need only install my successor successfully, and I shall be free to leave. Your assistance in this matter would be most helpful.&quot;</font></p>
      <p>A short time later, Logrus summoned his chief lieutenant, Bishop Seklor. His order was to summon forth the greatest Daemon ever known. And so it was that the Arch Vampire came into being. Seklor was exhausted from the summoning, and Logrus ordered him to rest, while he and the Daemon would go to meet Galek for the final time.</p>
      <p>Within moments, Seklor and those with him saw powerful explosions and the mightiest display of magik since the time of the High Ones. By the accounts of eyewitnesses, the battle lasted throughout the night. It was another day and night before anyone was able to approach the plateau, so thick was the magical residue. Those on the scene reported finding the plain had been blasted flat except for a shallow cavern in which the battered Daemon was found. The bodies of Galek and Logrus were never recovered. Seklor and his followers took the Daemon back to the Cult and a short time later, the Arch Vampire took over the leadership of the Cult, and led it into the Fifth Age of The World...</p>
