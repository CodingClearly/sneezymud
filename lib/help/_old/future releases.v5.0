Development for the initial release of v5.1 is nearing completion.  A few
last remaining things are being hacked together at this point in time.

At the appropriate time, the v5.1 mud will be put up in BETA mode on
port 7901.  The v5.0 mud will also remain up (on 7900) during the BETA
period.  A copy of player files and rent files will be put into the v5.1
area, but they will NOT be kept synchronized with the files in v5.0.
At the end of the beta period (hopefully less than a week), v5.0 will be
shut down for good, and the player/rent files from 5.0 will be moved into
v5.1.  The implication here is that work done on your character in the v5.1
beta mud will have no lasting impact.

                           V5.1 beta

The v5.1 beta period is intended to catch any significant problems in the
upgrade.  Yes, work is throw away, but if no-one playtests it, problems
won't be caught until things effect your "real" character.

==========================
03/25/99:
The MudAdmin has decided that the best way to progress is to look to our
past and restore some of the features and policies that have been lost
over the years.

To that end, the following things are underway:
 - Development of the v5.0 mud has ceased, save to fix crash bugs and to
   repair major exploits.
 - Development efforts are now directed toward the creation of a v5.1 version
   of the mud.

The Official Abstract for v5.1 reads:
v5.1 will be focused on reintroducing concepts that worked in prior versions
but that were removed in favor of code that is now viewed as problematic.
v5.1 will NOT introduce radical new concepts that have yet to be tried.  v5.1's
main intent is to provide a stable, feature-rich, enjoyable code base in a
minimal amount of time.

Unlike some of the previous version releases, the feature list for this is
being kept VERY short in order to get a quick release.

At this point in time, no player or rentfile wipe is being planned or
contemplated.
