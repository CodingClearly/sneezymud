<P>
Clients are external programs that assist the player by handling tedious
chores for them.  They typically offer aliases (the ability to substitute
a pattern of keystrokes for a much longer series: eg: FOOD = get food bag,
eat food, burp), actions (the ability to automatically perform some
action when certain text is sent to the character: eg: "You are hungry" =
eat bread) and other features (substitutions, highlights, gagging and
ease of playing multiple characters from one terminal).
<P>
The implementors recommend the use of the <A HREF="../client/index.html">SneezyMUD Client</A> which has been developed for Windows 95/NT platforms.

Some Unix users prefer a program known as Tintin++.  Unfortunately to a beginner it can be somewhat confusing.  Any questions regarding this program should be directed towards its developers, not the SneezyMUD Staff.
<P>
TinTin++ is available via anonymous FTP from:<BR>
