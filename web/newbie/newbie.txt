Introduction
------------

On behalf of the gods and implementors, I would like to welcome you to
<h>.  <h> was started by Brutius in May of 1992 from stock
SillyMUD code.  In the time since then it has undergone massive changes and
three separate and complete rewrites.  The World in which you now stand is
the result of thousands of manhours of coding and building.

But enough bragging, as you are no doubt somewhat confused at how to begin
actually playing, let me offer a few basic hints.  First, read this guide.
It offers much information both on how to play and what differences there
are between <h> code and Diku code.  Typing HELP will display
the highest level of our help-file structure.  More information on
HELP is contained in chapters 3 and 4.  Asking other players for clues
is another option.  Use some common sense though, it is better to ask
someone similar to you in level and class as they will better understand
your situation.  (The HELP WHO file will tell you how to find particular
people).  Many frequently asked questions are answered in the <h>
FAQ (available at the pawn shop) - definitely worth the modest price. If 
all else fails, the <h> gods can answer a wide variety of 
questions.  (Some rules apply on what can be divulged, see HELP GODS).
Races of <h>
------------------

Be sure to understand the races before making a selection in stone. 
<h>, at this stage, is very hard on non-human races.  By 
understanding the benefits and drawbacks of the races, you should
get a better idea of what you would like to play.

You should definitely read HELP RACE.
See the HELP files for each race: human, ogre, gnome, hobbit, elf, dwarf
before selecting your permanent character.
The <h> Faction System
----------------------------

Factions work as a combination of political affiliation and belief system.
All factions have a home base, dogma (beliefs) and supporting deities to
aid the faction in the supernatural affairs.  Factions typically have some
system of leadership that helps guide newer and less powerful members in
learning the way of the faction.  

There is also a built in feature for rating how well a given player is 
following the dogma of their faction called faction percentage (F% or FP).  
Faction percent has an effect on various aspects of the game, such as how
likely the faction's deity is to assist you (saving throw, fate and luck),
as well as how easy it is to draw upon the deity's power (piety regeneration).
It is not something that should be neglected.

Obviously, the simplest system is for the "unaffiliated" faction.  
Unaffiliateds believe in maintaining a STRICT NEUTRALITY.  In other words,
they need to assist and/or harm the other factions in an equal and equitable
manner.  Their goal is also to remove the extremists from The World, so
attacking the very devout of other factions is their best hope for victory.
Unaffiliateds have no formal system of leadership, preferring to retain their
individuality.  However, certain deities have arisen to support this doctrine
of neutrality, and hence unaffiliated have supernatural support for clerics.
Their center of power is the city of Grimhaven.

For more information on factions, and for details on the other factions that
exist, see HELP FACTIONS.
<h> Characteristics
-------------------------

The HELP CHARACTERISTICS file contains good background information on
what characteristics are, and what they affect.  Since there is a lot
of information in there for the Newbie, here are the things to consider.

Base characteristics are locked in at character generation time.  New players
are encouraged to set some characteristics and try them out, you will
undoubtedly want to experiment with some numbers before finally committing
yourself to any one setup.  Accept the fact that you may have to create a
number of characters before you get a set of characteristics you will be happy
with happy with over your whole career.

There is no "perfect" setup for characteristics.  This is largely an exercise
in personal preference and making acceptable tradeoffs.  On a final note, it
is not advisable to set as many characteristics to max as possible; you will
find that a near maxed characteristic is virtually identical to the maxed
quantities, while the sacrificed characteristics vary radically at the low
numbers (ie., diminishing returns).  That is, it may not be advantageous to
max a stat in detriment of others, you may suffer rather then benefit in the
end.

Lastly, realize that the natural and adjusted characteristics are the two key
ones.  If you chose a race that has a high natural strength, you probably do
NOT need to raise that strength further with your chosen characteristics.
This is a common mistake, usually made because of ignorance.  Example:
I want to make a warrior.  Warriors need good brawn.  If I am human, I will
probably want to put points into brawn since humans aren't that brawny.
However, if I opt for a dwarf or an ogre, I can get away without adding
more brawn points.  In fact, such a warrior may want to DECREASE their
brawn, in order to have spare points to offset the penalties those races have
in things like agility and dexterity.
Hints for Dressing for Your Class. 
--------------------------------------

<h> places an emphasis on dressing appropriately for the task at hand.
All equipment has various hidden attributes which range from everything from
amount of sound it creates, whether it conducts electricity, susceptibility
to acid, drag coefficient when swimming, etc.  These are all based on realistic
values and used in appropriate places.  The bottom line is that if you are
trying to attempt something that requires stealth while wearing noisy gear,
you will invariable fail.  Similarly, attempting to cast spells while tied up
in snug fitting armor will have appropriate detriments.

Having problems doing something?  Take a look at what you are wearing and
use common-sense.
Dressing for your race
----------------------

<h> has implemented size limits to various types of
armors.  No longer will you see a dwarf take off his plate mail
to swap it with an ogre's armor.  The size of your character will
determine which types of armor you can wear. Ogres and humans will
often be able to wear some of the same armor, as can elves and
dwarves.  It is important that you understand the races themselves
before making your final decision.  Your racial decision will affect
your character in a great many ways.

Also see: HELP RACE and HELP <race name>       (i.e. help dwarf)
<h>'s Revamped Spell and Prayer System
--------------------------------------------

The spell system in place for <h> is one that hopefully you'll find
more realistic than most mud magic systems.  (If you're having trouble
thinking of "magic" as "realistic" then you haven't been mudding enough.)

Overview
-------- 
Casting a spell requires none, one, or any combination of multiple 
components, each component of type verbal, gestural, or material.  Cleric 
prayers are granted success by their deities and will never require either a 
material component or a gestural component, but a cleric must always 
have a holy symbol to pray for any clerical prayer.  That holy symbol must 
either be held or worn at the time.  (See HELP HOLY SYMBOL and HELP 
DEVOTION.)

Also, each spell or prayer has a difficulty level (a value that dictates
the chance a cleric or mage has at successfully completing that spell) and a
mana or piety level (the amount of mana or piety drained from the 
magic-user to invoke the spell).  Based upon the difficulty level of a 
spell, the competence of the magic-user in the spell, the casters focus
and a random factor, the cast will result either in a success or
failure. However, it can also result unusually in either a critical
success or a critical failure.  

A critical success would result in extra damage done to the victim on an 
offensive spell (for example), while a critical failure could result in 
damage to the spell-caster and embarrassment at his lack of ability to 
perform the function of his life-training in front of others :)

Components - General
--------------------
Each spell requires none, one, or any combination of multiple 
components.  These components will each be of type verbal, 
gestural, or material.  A spell not properly prepared for by 
ignoring some or all the components is a wasted spell, and the 
caster is still required to pay the mana price -- the idea is 
that the caster went through the mind-numbing experience of 
attempting to draw upon pent up inherent energies from the ether 
and channel them into a useful force to do his bidding, except he 
screwed up and forgot a component.  The lesson is to be careful 
when preparing to mess with these forces and make sure the caster 
is properly prepared for spell-casting before he starts.  A mage
can change his level of ability in the "wizardry" skill (see also
HELP WIZARDRY) and not be required to perform as many gestural
and verbal components of a spell, restricting him less in tight
situations where his hands may be needed for something other than
arm-waving -- perhaps to wield a weapon or hold a torch.  The
player can determine the components required for each spell by
getting help on that spell (e.g., help fly).

Components - Verbal
-------------------
A verbal component is the spoken element of the spell-casting 
process.  It requires that the caster be able to speak, i.e., not 
magically silenced or in a silent room.  The mage can learn to cast
spells without any verbal incantation if necessary (see HELP WIZARDRY).

Components - Gestural
---------------------
A gestural component is the "arm waving" element of the spell
process.  It requires that the caster has usable arms and 
hands and is not holding anything in those hands.  There are four 
exceptions to this rule.  1) Clerics may hold a holy symbol in a 
hand while praying with a gestural component.  2) Material
components for a spell are required to be held in either the caster's
hand or in a component bag, which the caster must also hold in his
hand.  3) The mage's level of ability in the "wizardry" skill can
affect all of the above (see HELP WIZARDRY).  4) A cleric's level of 
ability in the "devotion" skill can affect the requirement of where he 
must hold or wear the holy symbol.

The player may assume that all verbal and gestural components are 
learned at the time of the character's training for them when he 
gains a level.  The human behind the keyboard is not required to 
type in a string of magical characters after a "say" command.

Components - Material
---------------------
A material component is a sacrificial item that is destroyed when 
the spell is cast.  A material component must be held by the 
caster in his hand at casting time but can alternatively be 
stored inside a component bag, which must be held by the caster.  
The individual material components required for various spells 
are all available around Grimhaven and its surrounding 
adventuring areas.  The mage can learn to use components
that are inside a component bag on his belt (see HELP WIZARDRY).

Holy Symbols - General
----------------------
 While a cleric will generally not be required to supply a material
component or perform a physical gesture to pray for a spell, a cleric will
always be required to have a holy symbol to cast any clerical spell.  A
holy symbol is the device through which a cleric's deity delivers a portion
of his power to the cleric to enable him to cast a spell.  Holy symbols must
be either held in a hand, worn or in inventory.  A cleric's holy symbol must
be attuned to the clerics faction to be usable by the cleric.  Once attuned,
it is not possible to un-attune or change the attunement of a holy symbol.
(See HELP DEVOTION, HELP ATTUNE and HELP HOLY SYMBOL) 

Holy Symbols - Strength
-----------------------
Each holy symbol has a strength level.  Each time a spell is channeled 
through a holy symbol, its structure is weakened.  Eventually, 
after enough use, the use of a holy symbol during prayer 
will cause the holy symbol to shatter.  The player will have to find 
another holy symbol before he can pray for another spell.  There are 
holy symbols of various strength levels scattered throughout 
Grimhaven and its surrounding adventuring areas for either 
purchase or discovery.  A good indication of a holy symbol's 
initial strength is the type of material it is made of.

Difficulty Level
----------------
The difficulty level of a spell is a value that depicts how easy 
or how difficult it is to successfully use a spell with a high level of 
efficiency to produce the desired results.  The range of values 
is TRIVIAL, EASY, NORMAL, DIFFICULT, and DANGEROUS.  These values 
dictate the magic-user's chances of successfully creating the 
spell, creating the spell perfectly (gaining bonuses), or 
accidentally screwing up, which could lead to unwanted results, 
like possible death or dismemberment :)

Mana, Piety, Meditation and Penance
-----------------------------------
Mages, also known as mana users, use their mana points to cast their 
spells. Certain spells will cost more mana points than others, and most 
spells decrease in cost upon reaching higher levels. The fastest way for 
a mana user to regain lost spell points is through focused meditation.  
This requires absolute silence in the room around the mana user.

Clerics use the power channeled to them from their deity, known as piety, 
to invoke their prayers.  Each prayer will cost the cleric a certain amount 
of piety, and like mana, most prayers decrease in cost upon reaching higher 
levels. The fastest way for a cleric to regain lost piety is through 
focused penance.  This requires absolute silence in the room around the 
cleric.

SEE HELP: meditate, mana, cast, piety, pray, magic, wizardry, devotion, 
penance
Communication for <h>
---------------------------

  On <h>, communication centers around the commands "say", "tell",
"whisper", "ask" and "emote".  Additionally, "shout" and some spells
have the ability to communicate with everybody at once, but there are
some rules of etiquette that must be followed (HELP SHOUT).

Shouting has changed a bit. Shouting will cost the shouter movement
for the strain his body takes from shouting. Also, the headrush after
a shout will result in a 2 second lag for the shouter. Mages can get
around these penalties by using their telepathy spell to globally
communicate.

  Although you must be level 2 to use the shout command, there are a few
instances when shouting is prohibited to everyone.  At times netlag can 
get very bad and an immortal will often ban shouting until the lag recedes 
a bit. Do understand shouting is seen by every person on the mud who does
not have their noshout flag set. So your shout is transmitted to every
person. And as you can probably see, shouting such things as "LAAGGG!!" 
when the lag *is* in fact bad, really does nothing but make it worse.

SEE HELP: shout, noshout
The <h> combat system
---------------------------

<h> has a limb-based combat system.  What does this mean?

It means that instead of just hitting and missing in combat, you
actually hit a specific body part. Your hit points now represent
the health in your vital areas. (Body, head, neck) Your limbs and
other body parts have their own 'health points' that get taken away
when the limb is hit. Your limbs can become damaged to the point of
uselessness and can become completely severed. Various spells can 
also affect/heal your limbs. 

With the ranged weapon system, weapons can be thrown from room to room.
These weapons can 'stick in' your body. Just as in real life, if 
something remains 'stuck' in your body, the body part can become 
infected. Your body parts can become infected, bleeding, and various
other 'bad' things. (Just like in real life).  If a part of your body
is infected and not healed quickly and properly, it could cause a loss
of total hit points, and inevitably death. Various clerical spells can
be used to heal/infect wounds in your limbs.  

A critical success/failure system has also been put in. Similar to the
D&D system of critical successes and failures, a certain die roll in
the combat functions can result in a crit. Critical successes range
from double or triple damage, to a rare automatic death. Failures
range from missing and hitting yourself, to a very rare self-killing.

Combat in <h> will stop when your opponent becomes stunned
or incapacitated. You can choose at that time to take your victory,
or you can choose to do your opponent in for good. (See HELP AUTO)

Weapon Specialization:  Apart from just learning a specific weapon class to
proficiency, one may choose to specialize in it.  By spending extra 
practices on a weapon class after proficiency is obtained, one may become
specialized in a weapon class and thereby gain bonuses when using that
particular weapon type.

SEE HELP: auto, limbs

SIDENOTE : Since experience is given on a per hit basis, the old trick
of getting a monster down to stunned to let a newbie get the final blow
will do no good. 

This limb based system opens up a whole new realm of possibilities
for <h>. It should be a very fun and realistic system to play!
Ranged weapons for <h> 
----------------------------

On <h>, combat can take place from room to room. Not only 
can weapons and other objects be thrown from room to room, but bows
and arrows can be shot across rooms as well.

The commands to use ranged weapons are throw (for thrown items) and
shoot (for bows and arrows). The help files on these two commands will
tell you the correct syntax.

SEE HELP: throw, shoot, bload

Coming soon : Ranged spells (spells that can be cast from room to room)
The <h> system of lighting and vision
-------------------------------------------

The system of lighting on <h> is most probably different from any
other MUD lighting system you have experienced. 

All objects, characters and mobs are rated for how much light
is required to notice them.  Light is produced by the sun
(various amounts depending on time of day and only outside),
lanterns, light posts, torches, glowing objects, etc.  The
actual amount varies from light-source to light-source.  If
the amount of total light in a room exceeds something's "can-be-
seen" factor, then you will be able to notice it.

There are a few more quirks though.  For instance, some magic items
can cause your sight to improve, effectively giving you night vision
to one extent or another.  Also, some races have infravision which permits
HEAT sources to be seen (objects have no intrinsic heat though).

Realize that just because you can see SOME things in a room, does NOT mean
that everything is visible.  It's fairly easy to lose track of something in
dim lighting so you may actually want to bring multiple lanterns while
adventuring (put a few on the ground and light them, then hold another one
in your hand.  See HELP LIGHT.)

Finally, this light system works both ways.  Some dangerous mobs can be
bypassed by going by them at night in the dark.  Don't rely too much on this
as a lot of creatures can see in the dark.
Quick Start
-----------

Although it is highly recommended that first time <h> players read the
newbie guide thoroughly, here is a list of things to do for those
who feel they don't need to read help files to play.

1) Consult the following help files.
   GOD
   GOTO
   COLOR
   PROMPT
   WEAPON PROFICIENCY
   AUTO
   LIMBS
   ITEM DAMAGE
   WIMPY
   ASSIST
   BRIEF
   ABBREVIATIONS
   
2) Go through all help files thoroughly when you have the chance.  Time
   spent regenerating mana, move or hit points is an excellent time to
   read the help files.

3) Before running around killing things, find your trainer and practice. 
   You receive a specific number of practices (dependent on your wisdom
   and intelligence, chapter 12) from character generation. Use the
   "goto" command to find your trainer.

4) Wear all equipment and wield any weapons you find.  You are given some
   basic gear at the outset, but almost anything you find will be better.

5) Visit Center Square for food and water.  'drink fountain' and 'pray'.

6) If you lose your gear as a newbie, you should see the social worker.
<h> Physics
-----------------

Just like in the real world, what goes up must come down on
<h>. If you somehow get in the air and aren't flying
you will fall down until you hit the ground. As well, any time
you are in water, and can't swim, you will sink to the bottom.
Objects also are affected by gravity, therefore any object dropped
in the air or water that doesn't have floating abilities will
drop until it hits the ground.

Obviously falling many rooms and hitting the ground can be very
harmful to you. It can also be harmful to the people on the ground,
as you have a chance to land on them and hurt them as well.
<h>'s Rental System
-------------------------

Rent is, and always has been, a touchy subject on muds.  It largely boils
down to the problem of insuring that "cool stuff" is available, and
not requiring that people have to play 24/7.

<h> has experimented with a wide-variety of rent schemes, including
the absence of rent, each of which had limited success.  Ultimately, we
settled on what we refer to as the "rent-credit" system.

Essentially, all equipment has a value, called the rental cost, assigned
according to its value.  Better items have higher rental costs.  At the
same time, players are awarded a credit based on their level and playtime.
If your credit exceeds your total rent cost, you pay nothing!  Players using
high quality equipment will most likely exceed the rent credit by a small
amount.  That difference defines their daily rent.

Example:
I have 3 items with rental costs of 100, 50 and 75 respectively.  My total
cost is 225 (the sum).  Based on my level, I am given a credit of 200.
My total daily rent is then 25 (225 - 200).  If I gain another level, I
may then get a rental credit of 300, at which point for my current gear
I would pay nothing.

Daily rent is charged for the time you are not actually playing.  Thus,
if I go on a week's vacation with a daily rent of 25, you will be charged
175 (25 * 7) upon your return.  If you log off to go sleep for 12 hours,
expect a bill of 13 (half-day) on your return.
The <h> Volume System
---------------------------

Volume is how much space an item takes up, and every item in the game has a
volume value.  Your character can carry a certain amount of volume and still
maintain enough control of himself to move efficiently.  It makes sense that
a player carrying a 'very large chest' is not going to be able to manage much
else, so a large chest would have a very high volume.  Holding items in your
hands decreases the amount of volume you can manage as those hands become
tied up in holding the object rather than being free to carry other stuff. 

Volume capacity (the max you can carry at the given time) is affected by
your dexterity and ALSO by what is in your hands.  Obviously, a player
wielding a sword and holding a shield can't juggle as much volume as they
could if both hands were free.  

Don't confuse volume (a measure of size) with weight (a measure of mass).
Weight capacity is a function of strength.

The use of bags, backpacks and other containers will help reduce some items
volume as they are packed, crammed, and stuffed inside.  Not everything
is compressed the same; compression depends largely on what sort of material
the item is made of (cloth compresses, steel doesn't).

MULTIPLAYING
-------------------
Players allows to have one player character on at any given time
on the MUD. You may not have two PC's on at the same time for ANY 
length of time.

Each player is to have only one account which only they may use.
Rules for playing multiple-characters (multiplay) on <h> 
-----------------------------------------------

(Proposed rules for v5.1)

The number of players you may have simultaneously connected is dependant on
the current player load.  These limits are only checked when you log in
and you will not be kicked out should the threshold go up after you have
already started playing (you may be unable to reconnect should you lose
link, or die, however).

    if fewer than 15 players total : may have 1 characters connected
    if 15-29 players total         : may have 1 characters connected
    if 30-59 players total         : may have 1 characters connected
    if 60+ players total           : may have 1 character connected

The multiplay limit will always be 1 for the first 30 minutes after any reboot
so that there is no "race to reconnect" during the low-player loads of the
reboot cycle.

Any multiplay situation MUST be amongst characters in the SAME account.
These rules do not override the prohibition against multiple accounts.
Immortality on <h>
------------------------

Upon reaching level 50 in all of your respective classes, you can petition
to become a member of the <h> builders and immortals if you wish to
help contribute to the MUD.  Anyone who reaches level 50 in all classes
will be given the choice to stay a mortal, or to become a level 51 builder.

Level 51 builders can contribute in a number of ways.  Those that like to
build will be given a zone and be allowed to construct an area.  Those who
prefer to do roleplaying can run major quests for the players, or can 
design the coded quests.  Players who are especially knowledgeable in a
specific class may be asked to help provide input to the coding team.

Promotion past Level 51 is dependent upon an individuals contribution to
the MUD.  At this point, the immortal can advance his/her level by 
continuing to build or by continuing to play the MUD and helping things run
smoothly.

Builders are denoted as [Area Design] in a 'who -bl' listing. These people
are *NOT* gods, but immortals.  They are not to deal in mortal affairs and
do not speak with the authority of the gods.  It is in your best interest
that you bring your problem to a true god who can actually help you.
The use of storage characters is ILLEGAL and grounds for character deletion
or other punishment.

A storage character is defined as any character created for the expressed
purposes of skirting the rules on rent or equipment sharing.  This
includes, but is not limited to:
  1.) A character given an 18 karma to purchase items.
  2.) Switching equipment between PC's whether directly or indirectly.
  3.) A character used to hang onto an item until some other character 
      needs it.
The official policy states:
      Player killing is "legal" and permitted.  However, if you, the PC,
      start to PK without valid cause or reason, or with malicious intent
      to the detriment of other's enjoyment of the game, you will be punished
      - up to and including character deletion and site-banning. Basically
      player killing falls under the same laws as player looting. It is
      legal, unless done in excess, or insipidly.
 
Being player killed causes experience point loss as is standard for any death.
Committing a PK does NOT give you any exp nor does it affect alignment.
 
Immortals have been instructed to pay close attention to player deaths involving
anyone less than level 5.  Killing a newbie tends to give the mud a negative
atmosphere and if you feel obligated to do this, you damn well better have not
only a good reason but be able to justify your action to one of the admins.

In a PK situation, it is mandatory that the PK'er allow the victim a chance to
seek revenge.  This means that immediately leaving the game following a PK is
regarded as unfair, and hence illegal.  In general, a PK'er must spend a few
minutes in a non-peaceful room.  The mud code enforces this; you will not be
allowed to rent or enter a peaceful room for an amount of time following a PK.
If you lose link, you will remain visible to the world and vulnerable to attack.
PK'ers are not required to let the victim catch them after a PK, just stay around long enough that the opportunity to be caught presented itself.

The AUTO NOHARM flag will prevent you from intentionally inflicting damage on
another PC.  See HELP AUTO for information on how to set your noharm flag.
The official policy states:
      Player looting is "legal" and permitted.  However, if you, the PC,
      start to PL without valid cause or reason, or with malicious intent
      to the detriment of other's enjoyment of the game, you will be punished
      - up to and including character deletion and site-banning. Basically
      it is legal, unless done in excess, or insipidly.
 
While we permit and acknowledge that looting does and will occur, this does
not mean that the admins/gods condone such actions.  Before you partake of
someone else's hard earned treasure, ask yourself if the character you are
supposedly roleplaying would honestly do that.  Also realize that when you
loot someone, they feel obligated to loot someone else, and ultimately someone
will feel obligated to loot you.

If player looting took place as a result of a PK, then be sure to meet all 
of the conditions required for post-PK play (staying around, etc).  It is
required that a looter that wishes to keep the looted equipment, provide the
opportunity of revenge (as per PK policy).  A looter may freely dispose of 
(sell, auction or junk) the equipment before giving the victim a shot at revenge
(eg, hiding in a peaceful room is allowed), so long as an opportunity at
revenge with the benefits of whatever came from the disposal is made possible.
(eg., if they sell the goods, then a shot at the talens acquired has to occur).
If the items are disposed of by giving them away, the receiver of the goods
will be regarded as a conspirator and must also meet the conditions as if they
had done the PL themselves.

Getting Help and Other Info
---------------------------

The on-line help files are considered "basic knowledge" and they do contain
some other rules, caveats, warnings and the like.  They are also cross-
referenced and indexed.  Type HELP to get the basic help menu which lists
the relevant sub-indexes.  Alternatively, you can jump right to the file
you want if you do HELP (command/file name).  It is a good idea to read the
help file on any command before you use it, even innocuous sounding commands
_might_ have something strange about them that you are expected to know about.

Major changes and code updates are detailed in the NEWS (type: NEWS).  NEWS
always supersedes help files, although the help files eventually get updated
with the changes from news.

See chapter 4 for more info on NEWS.

The Mortal board and NEWS.
--------------------------

As <h> is quite often updated with new codes and rules, it
is important that you be aware of these changes. Ignorance of
new rules is not an excuse on <h>. Players are expected to
keep themselves updated on all the new information the immortals
take the time to write.

The mortal board:
----------------

The mortal board is a place where the players (you) can 
communicate via messages posted on a virtual bulletin board. 
Debates and discussions often arise on certain aspects of the 
mud, and it is certainly a good idea to follow them actively as 
they may pave the way to a new rule or code change on <h>.
The mortal board is located above the Roaring Lion Inn in Grimhaven
as well as other locations.

On <h>, your input is important to us. We are striving to
make the best mud possible, and player feedback is vital to
inform us of what is lacking and, of course, what is good.
Simple things are best communicated to the gods via the
BUG, IDEA or TYPO commands.

NEWS:
-----

The news command is perhaps one of the most important informative
commands on <h>.  All code updates and rule changes will be
put in the <h> news.  Be sure to check it regularly for new
information. After reboots is a particularly good time to check
the news as code update is always preceded by a reboot.  This will
save you the embarrassment of asking an immortal if there is any
new code or rule changes when it is clearly in the news :)

<h> LISTSERV AND THE WEB PAGE
-----------------------------------

The <h> listserver offers a way for <h>'s most devoted players
to converse on virtually any subject related to <h>.  Frequently, the
implementors will detail forthcoming changes or engage in rational debate
about the worth of some policy or code change.  This is probably the most
interactive forum, and it tends to see many raw and unformed ideas eventually
polished up and put into actual play.  All interaction with the listserver is
handled by email.  See HELP LISTSERV for details on how to subscribe.

The <h> web page offers various and sundry bits of info about the other
gods and players of the game, plus a good deal of canon material for public
knowledge.  See HELP WEBSITE for the present address.
Useful help files for a <h> newbie
-------------------------------------------

By looking at HELP, you can be led through virtually
every help file on <h>. We strongly urge you to look
through the help files, and go through the help files, so you can
become acquainted with the many unique things on <h>.

Some useful help files to start off with :

ABBREVIATIONS, ALIAS, ATTACK, BLOAD, CAST, CASINO, CHANGE, 
CLEAR, CLS, COLOR, COMPONENT, DEITIES, DISMOUNT, DRAG, 
EXTINGUISH, GIN, HISTORY, HOLY SYMBOL, LIGHT, LIGHTING, 
MAILING LIST, MOUNT, PRAY, REFUEL, RENT, REPAIR, SCAN,
SHARPEN, SHELL, SHOUT, TERMINAL, TITLE

Again, the help index can lead you through every help file on the MUD.
It is strongly advised that the new character on <h> spend
a good bit of time starting out looking at the help files and this
newbie book. There are a lot of differences in this MUD and others,
and reading up on the help files can only help you cope with the
changes!
How is <h> different from every other MUD?
------------------------------------------------

In the past few years, MUDs have exploded around the net.  It sometimes
seems that everyone and their brother is putting up a mud.  Unfortunately,
most of these muds are stock MUDs.  A stock MUD is a mud which was developed
by a group of experienced coders, and the source code for which was then made
publicly available.  This means that every stock mud is just like every other
stock mud in terms of code, creatures, rooms, objects, features, etc...  In
fact the only differences that really exist are in how the runners of the
games act (or handle problems) as well as the few (if any) modifications that
the mud creates for itself.

<h> was originally developed from the SillyMUD stock code (opened June
1992) making <h> a member of the DIKU (essentially a combat-oriented MUD)
family of muds.  However, unlike most stock muds, <h> made a commitment
to continued development.  In the many of its life, the mud has been
rewritten three times, once to add vastly more functionality, once to upgrade
from C to C++, and once again to add even more functionality.  This attention
to innovation can be seen in the differences between <h> and other muds.

At the same time, the libraries of mobs, objects and rooms were completely 
replaced to make use of the advanced features that had been incorporated.  
While we have maintained the "look-and-feel" of the standard DIKU mud, the 
guts of the mud are a completely different beast.
The World for <h>
-----------------------

The World as we know it revolves around the great city of Grimhaven. 
Grimhaven, which sits upon a great plateau in the center of our world, has a
long and rich tradition.  At the dawn of human history, two great forces held
The World.  The forces of Galek Brightmoon, inhabited the western plains,
living off the land.  They were a good folk who were benevolent in their
ways and respectful of others.  After many years of farming and sea-faring,
the goodness of people started to fade.  Laziness and greed overcame many of
Galek's people, causing crime, poverty, and despair in Galek's kingdom.

The era of the crime lords came, and the leader of the crime lords was
a man known as Logrus.  Logrus and Galek fought many battles, splitting
their society in two.  Galek had a vision from the gods that a great storm
would rise up and destroy his people if they did not repent.  Galek set
forth to make a treaty with Logrus.

Logrus and Galek met on a hill in the central plains of Haven to pronounce
their peace.  But peace was not to be, as Logrus had his Bishop, Seklor,
summon a great beast from another plane to help Logrus finally claim his
victory.  Seklor had summoned the Arch Vampire, whose contempt for all
living creatures brought a shadow over all man-kind.

The battle raged for nearly three hours.  In the end, Galek Brightmoon was
dead, but Logrus had been mortally wounded as well.  The Arch Vampire used
its power to draw the last bit of power from Logrus's limp body, and tried
to lay claim to the throne of Logrus.  It claimed The World as its, but
the former followers refused to follow the usurper.  The Arch vampire 
retreated from the surface world, while the Logrites awaited the rise
of a new leader.

In the years that followed, the former followers of Logrus reunited and
formed the Cult of Logrus, dedicated to bringing peace and order to the
world.  The Cult's power spread far and wide, but its leadership and 
teachings were corrupt. 

In the west, a small band stood up to the tyranny of the Cult and The
Brotherhood of Galek was born.  Befriending the Tytans, a race of
creatures the Cult had enslaved, the Brotherhood defeated the shock troops
of the Cult and ensured the perseverance of the Brotherhood.  From that
day forth, the Brotherhood and the Tytans have been united in their
efforts to defeat the Cult and offer The World an alternative teaching
than what the Cult offers.  They erected a great city in the west as a
monument to the teachings of Galek and called it Brightmoon. 

Generations passed, and The World was split into two.  A city grew at the
sight of the great battle, and was commonly known as Grimhaven.  This city
was the center for most of The World's trading, and the citizens of
Grimhaven were committed to remaining untouched in a world of chaos and
upheaval.

This is how our world is today, with the forces of Logrus to the east and the
forces of Galek to the west.

Roleplaying on <h>
------------------------

  One of the most important jobs on the new <h> 
for immortals and gods will be roleplaying. From a mortal point
of view this will mean many more quests than you experienced
on the older versions of <h>. This also means, though, 
that certain mobiles, when being roleplayed, will take on a
more realistic character.

  Players are advised that at any time, a mobile character can and might
be roleplayed by one of the immortals. These type situations certainly lead
to a more fun MUD. Instead of just hacking and slashing on the same
mobs over and over, the mobs will have personalities based on
what god is playing in them at the time.

An example scenario follows : An unnamed god switches into a small dragon
outside of Grimhaven. Since the dragon is hungry, she starts to go around
searching for food. She moves around shouting that she is looking for
food, and that she would just love a tasty human for lunch. If the higher
level players rush to kill the dragon before she can make it to town, then
the threat is over. However if the dragon make it into town, she might
very well attack the first human she sees, based on her hunger. 

  As long as the mortals on the MUD participate, these types of situations
can add a lot to the game. 

  Obviously any abuse of powers will be dealt with accordingly.
Hopefully with good immortals, and willing mortals, the role-playing
environment on <h> can make it a very fun place to be!
