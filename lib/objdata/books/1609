General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF REMORSE:

As the regret the Faeries felt over causing the death of their Elven kin ran
its course, they began to ponder how to undo their mistake.  "The dwarves
have gone bad," they said, "we must defend our kin from these dwarves."  "The
dwarves were a mistake!  We will do better this time."

And so, the Faeries set about creating a new race to act as defenders of the
Elves.  They gave their new creation as many of their own qualities as they
could - great magikal power coupled with the solidarity of group consciousness,
for these they rationalized were their own greatest strengths.  To this they
added great wisdom, for they assumed it would be needed to outwit the dwarves
and to survive in The World.  And lastly they inserted as much of the dwarven
strength of character and constitution as they could muster.  This new creation
they named Gnomes, and charged them with the defense of Elvenkind.

But the Faeries had done too masterful a job of instilling wisdom in the
Gnomes, for the Gnomes instantly realized the futility in taking sides.  They
opted for the path of neutrality and set themselves to the task of multiplying
and surviving.
