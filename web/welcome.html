<DD><I><B> Well my friend, it seems our Realm has grown, new magics have been unleashed, and the very scope of our adventures have been reshaped by the hands of the gods.  I hope you'll continue your adventures, or begin a new one, here within the realms of SneezyMUD!
<DD> Here you will hopefully find adventure, enjoyment, and a welcome place in the taverns to tell your tales. The Immortals of the realm have placed themselves at your disposal to create a realm in which you can forget the toils of your borish world and droll life.  Hopefully through these writtings you will gain the knowledge to survive the harsh adventures of the realm, the spark of interest to explore those far off regions or darkest holes, and a better knowledge and understanding of your fellow adventurers. So continue reading and let us start with the simple history of events leading to the SneezyMUD world you will see today.

<COMMENT>
<DD>I'm happy to welcome you to SneezyMUD on behalf of the implementors,
gods, and devoted players.  SneezyMUD began its history in May of 1992 from
stock SillyMUD code acquired by Brutius.  Since that time SneezyMUD has 
went through massive changes and three complete code upgrades brought about
by thousands of man-hours put in by Brutius, his coding staff, and the Sneezy
builders.  SneezyMUD is now one of the top MUDs on the internet for its 
unique world and features.  In the upgrade to version 4.0 SneezyMUD has 
been completely converted to C++ code and almost all traces of Diku or 
SillyMUD code are now gone.<P>
</COMMENT>

<DD>SneezyMUD Invitation:  You are hereby invited to try one of the most
dynamic, fun, and complete fantasy muds on the internet.  The dynamism
comes from the attitude of the immortal staff.  The fun from the spirit,
attitude and general playfulness of our players.  The depth of features
and completeness has come from *constant* coding for 6+ years.  Not 6
months from diku stock, or 2 years, but 6+ full years of mud coding from
some of the most ambitious and dedicated mud coders on the internet.
<P>

<DD>SneezyMud's new version is SneezyMud 5.0. Those of you who tried Sneezy
2.5, 3.0, or 4.0 already know the advanced state of our code. We hope youu
will be pleased by the advances since those code versions.  Those of you
who tried 4.0 will be also be surprised at the changes since 4.0.
Although similar to 4.0, SneezyMud 5.0 has many more features and its
balance has been shifted around a bit making it a slightly different and
better mud.  Those who have not tried Sneezy will be amazed at the code,
world, and features.
<P>

<DD>Both code and world is fantasy based (the name Sneezy relates to our
first machine and we have resisted changing it as a nod to our history).
This fantasy world has the following features which you are invited to
partake in:
