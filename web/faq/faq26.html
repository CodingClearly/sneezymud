<P>
Refer to HELP <A HREF="../help/reimburse">REIMBURSE</A> for starters.  In general, dying just before the
game crashed or rebooted is valid reason to get a reimbursement.  If the
game did not crash, then HELP <A HREF="../help/losing_link">LOSING LINK</A> probably explains your situation.
<P>
In both cases, you will need a 54+ level god.  WHO -GL to see who's on.
<P>
The other obvious alternative is that you couldn't afford your rent and
the rent contingencies as detailed in HELP <A HREF="../help/rent">RENT</A> occurred.
