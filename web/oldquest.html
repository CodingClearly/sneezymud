<H3>Prelude:</H3>
<H5><I>This tale has been put together from the memories of the monk Grandmaster Peel, the mighty paladin Tandth,
and my own experiences during this time prior to the Age of Dragons.</I></H5>
<P>The beginnings of the Age of Dragons started before any mortal in the realm realized. As with any great tale
of glory, the beginning was simple. Travelers had claimed to have seen an ogre zombie somewhere near Grimhaven.
The undead were not all that uncommon to the Realms, for many times have the fair folk of Grimhaven beaten back
hordes of invaders from the dark wilds beyond Grimhaven. This ogre though caught the attention of all for rather
than mindlessly attacking people it merely asked for help. It cried over the loss of its broomstick and promised
to reward any who could return it. As usual from the city of Grimhaven some warriors chose to answer the call.
The mighty mage-warrior Drentar and the fearsome martial artist Grandmaster Peel took up the challenge, and would
in the end come up against a fearsome two-headed snake. The battle went hard, but eventually Grandmaster Peel summoned
up all his years of training and dealt death to the fearsome beast. The magic broomstick was presented to the ogre
zombie and an apparently simple good deed seemed to be completed. Rather than give the generous warriors treasure,
the zombie gave rather ominous news. He told that a dark force was after an old object of magic known as the corpse
of Therin Altair, and that a dwarf would have to be taken in peace to receive news of how to attain it.</P>
<P>Doubtful of the unstable zombie, the people of Grimhaven chose to send adventurers anyway to confirm the story.
The brave dwarf Flint became the chosen one to venture into the realm of the wood elves. Knowing that the wood
elves bore a hatred to their ancient enemies the dwarves, a brave band of warriors was sent to aid the dwarf. Using
magic scrolls the heroes were able to present the dwarf to the la representative of the wood elves. Despite the
racial hatred toward dwarves, a certain elf of noble descent realized the coming danger and was awaiting a chosen
one to impart the news.&nbsp; Knowing that no dwarf has willingly entered the woody realm of the elves in peace
in ages, he recognized that Flint was indeed the chosen one. Sadly, the noble elf could only set the group on the
right track. The band was told to seek out the legendary stone oracle in the camps of the ogre-kin. It was then
that the band knew that a great quest lay before them if they were to truly find the corpse of Therin Altair. Among
the first questers were the mighty warrior Damian, the paladin Tandth, the archpope Warluk, the brave dwarf Flint,
and&nbsp; I, the Archmage, would later join. The search for the stone oracle proved dangerous for the ogres were
known for their hatred of humans. In the end after much fighting, the group made their way to the stone oracle.
The oracle took the armor of Damian as payment for his news. The stone oracle told the band that only by talking
to a dark overlord, who themselves were of the darkness, would the band would ever find out about the corpse of
Therin Altair. The stone oracle then demanded a sacrifice of life for the information. The group defiantly refused
and the stone oracle was defeated and sent back into his prison inside the mysterious circle. The dark overlord
refused to give up whereabouts of the corpse of Therin Altair, but revealed that Grimhaven's sworn enemy the Arch
Vampire was the one looking for the corpse of Therin Altair. The Dark Overlord demanded souls in return for his
information, but the overlord was not match for the might of the heroes.&nbsp; Knowing that the Arch Vampire was
behind the search for the corpse, the group returned to Grimhaven to prepare for a very deadly confrontation with
their long time foe.</P>
<P>Through his network of spies, the Arch Vampire learned that the people of the realms were planning to thwart
his plans. In response the Arch Vampire cast a powerful spell of continual cold on the town of Grimhaven and sent
out bounty hunters to eliminate the heroes one by one before the band could set out for his dark crypt. The group
managed to kill several bounty hunters before they had to separate. The band knew that with the temporary disbanding,
each of them were more susceptible to the many bounty hunters being sent out for them. The first to be attacked
was none other than the Archmage Moath. Using powerful spells, many opponents fell before the Master of the Arcane,
but he knew that he could not keep fighting forever. Sending forth a call for help, he was immediately answered
by citizens of Grimhaven and later by Tandth the paladin and many more warriors of Grimhaven. The battle raged
throughout the streets of Grimhaven as the band strove to protect the citizens of Grimhaven. After many deaths,
the bounty hunters realized that no bounty was worth the risk to their lives and they withdrew.</P>
<P>Now having the initiative, the reformed band gathered many new warriors such as Ghomer, Onslaught, and many
more, and set out for the crypt of the Arch Vampire. The dark temple Guardian, and all the temple guards and many
mercenaries barred the way to the crypt but could not withstand the force of adventurers. Even the evil Bishop
Seklor fell to the might of the band. But when the heroes had reached the site of the Octopus that was set to prevent
entrance, there was no sign of the mighty monster. The band knew something was wrong, and when they finally battled
through the skeletal hordes to reach the inner sanctum of the crypt, the only person to greet them was a bound
and gagged hobbit adventurer. The hobbit told of how he too had come in search of the Arch Vampire, and that he
had mysteriously disappeared. The hobbit knew though that the master thief Scar could reveal the location of the
Arch Vampire. Thanking the brave hobbit, the band set out for the city of Grimhaven. Deep below the city the group
confronted the sly thief. The master thief agreed to reveal the whereabouts of the Arch Vampire, but if he were
to risk his life, then he would need the long lost artifact known as the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords. The band knew
they would suffer greatly if they were to defeat the fearsome beast. It was then that the water mage Nemo came
up with the idea to cast spells to wrench the great axe from the grasp of the Ky'lishra, and in so doing avoid
a costly battle. Nemo's plan paid off, for the band managed to get the Axe without the loss of life. <BR>
Returning to Scar with the axe, Scar revealed that the Arch Vampire was preparing dark rituals among the druids
of the badlands. Though the Archmage had pressing business elsewhere and could not aid his fellows in the final
confrontation, the paladin Tandth later related how the brave band battled long and hard but were forced to regroup
before the anger of the Arch Vampire. It was then that Lotus a powerful mage in his own right came to the aid of
the group. With this new aid and the wounds already inflicted upon the Arch Vampire, victory was gained. Unfortunately
there was no sign of the corpse of Therin Altair. Defeated, the Arch Vampire's spirit returned to his crypt. Though
the group knew that the Arch Vampire demanded vengeance, nothing was heard from him for quite awhile. It was then
that rumors began that another even darker force had caught the attention of the Arch Vampire, and that rumors
of the evil dragons returning in force to the Realm began. The battle against the Arch Vampire, the search for
the corpse of Therin Altair, and the rumors of the dragons would serve to set the stage for what historians now
call the Age of the Dragons.&nbsp;</P>

<H3>The Coming of the Dark Queen:</H3>
<H5><I>This chronicle tells the tale of the Coming of the Dark Queen and the Beginning of the Age of Dragons.&nbsp;
By the time the Dark Queen was vanquished, many adventurers would answer the call to arms.&nbsp; Some famous adventurers
of note were Tandth, Drentar, Oakk, Bump, Lotus, Albria, Peel, Amakusa, Phoenyx, Tulkas, Bulwark, Rehman, Onslaught,
Ternoth, Yosh, Atropos, Judas, Eternity, Alyria, Oden, Kragg, Vesalius, Sidartha, Crazed, Crumpler, Ghomer, Loki,
and myself.</I></H5>
<P>Not long after the defeat of the Arch Vampire in his bid for power, a dark time came upon the realm.&nbsp; As
the darkness began to cover the land, the balance of the Realm was shattered.&nbsp; Hordes of monsters began to
become more aggressive.&nbsp; Rumors began to spread of evil armies massing for war.&nbsp; Having just defeated
the Arch Vampire though, most discounted the rumors as the overactive imaginations of those who dwelled on the
fringes.&nbsp; Then came an omen of the rising force of evil in the Realm.&nbsp; An invasion of beholders swept
across the realm attacking all in its path.&nbsp; Most scoffed at this sign, believing it to be an isolated event.&nbsp;
The battle-hardened warriors of Grimhaven led a campaign to quickly drive back the beholders.&nbsp; Sages warned
that this was but a drop of rain in the storm that was to come, but most simply chose to ignore them.</P>

<P>A few days later, another minor nuisance seemed to have arisen. The ranger guards in the LanQuin forest reported
that there appeared to be a minor infestation in the forest.&nbsp; Though the number of monsters was too great
for the ranger guard, they reported that a minor force should be sufficient in clearing out the forest.&nbsp; A
small force under the leadership of Valerian the Ranger Knight was sent to help clear out the forest. Though the
first few skirmishes proved easy for the small band, they soon found that they were not fighting an infestation,
but rather an organized army.&nbsp; Berserkers from the savage lands, tritons, automatons, beholders, and other
lesser creatures of evil fought as a single force driving the small band from Grimhaven back and slaying many of
them in the process. Reports of this threat to the city reached the ears of the city officials, and reinforcements
were sent for.&nbsp; The mighty paladin Tandth, aided by the great warrior Crazed, and the nimble thief Loki, took
command of the brave band and led a counterattack.&nbsp; This stronger force managed to fight its way clear to
the center of the evil horde.&nbsp; To the groups shock, the evil horde was being commanded by a young red dragon.&nbsp;
Long was the fight to vanquish this evil one.&nbsp; Finally the forces of Grimhaven won out and the dragon was
slain.&nbsp; Upon seeing their leader fall, most of the horde fled and the remainder were easily handled by the
group of adventurers.&nbsp; On returning to the outpost, one of the ranger guards told the group of a strange vision
he had.&nbsp; He explained that the evil dragons had returned to haunt the realm, and a powerful force was vying
for domination of the entire realm.&nbsp; This force was seeking out special items that would ensure its victory
and that the spirit of Jezebel Mallard must be sought out to help combat this force.&nbsp; This legendary wife
of Galek Brightmoon was said to have been trapped on this plane due to her cruel murder by a jealous admirer (rumors
of the time point to Logrus).&nbsp; By aiding the people of this realm, she might finally find peace.&nbsp; Knowing
now that the coming danger was real, cities began preparing its citizens for coming danger.</P>
<P>The people of the Realm did not have to wait long for the trouble to escalate.&nbsp; Shortly after the Battle
of LanQuin, a cry for help rose up from the drow city of Tir Na Zgoth.&nbsp; News of the city under siege quickly
reached Grimhaven.&nbsp; The Archmage quickly gathered a force to aid the drow in their time of need.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unfortunately&nbsp; the city fell to the mysterious invaders before the band from Grimhaven could reach the gates
of Tir Na Zgoth.&nbsp; Knowing that the drow had already been enslaved, the band lay siege to the city.&nbsp; After
a bloody fight at the city gates against dread automatons, the mighty band managed to enter the city.&nbsp; What
followed was a bloody battle that raged down every street of Tir Na Zgoth as the vengeful band fought its way to
the Keep of Endless Night.&nbsp; The adventurers once more faced evil dragons as they did battle with a young red
dragon and a young black dragon for control of the Keep.&nbsp; After slaying the dragon and rescuing the drow in
the keep, the brave band began to fight on top the city walls in an effort to drive the remainder of the evil horde
from the city.&nbsp; To the groups shock, a more sinister creature awaited them on top the citys walls.&nbsp; A
foul death knight was commanding the forces that held the walls.&nbsp; Tandth in his holy indignation challenged
the death knight to single combat.&nbsp; Despite wounding the death knight gravely, Tandth was not able to slay
the knight.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mighty band managed to rescue Tandth, and together they slew the foul knight.&nbsp;
Believing the fight was over, the band returned to Grimhaven, only to find that the death knight was merely a minion.&nbsp;
With pressing matters elsewhere, Moath left the band and Tandth took up the gauntlet of leadership as the adventurers
returned to Tir Na Zgoth.&nbsp; Another death knight had rallied the forces of darkness and sent them against the
brave band.&nbsp; Another long bloody fight ensued which culminated in the return of the Archmage and a final stand
on the Siege Tower of Doom.&nbsp; With their combined might, the adventurers from Grimhaven were able to finally
drive out the evil from Tir Na Zgoth.&nbsp; Upon their victory, a vision of Jezebel Mallard appeared to group and
told them to seek her out in Grimhavens Park.&nbsp; After a long drawn out search, the spirit of Jezebel Mallard
was found at Mallards Rest.&nbsp; It was here that it was learned that the evil horde was under the command of
the deity known as the Dark Queen, and it was she that brought back the dragons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jezebels love Galek
had returned to the lands, but the Dark Queen was keeping him prisoner.&nbsp; The Dark Queen had been given the
power to enter the realm by a curse laid by Logrus in his anger at not having Jezebel.&nbsp; The Dark Queen hunted
for Jezebel to use her essence to enhance her dark powers.&nbsp; Jezebel explained that only by defeating the Dark
Queen could she and Galek be laid to rest.&nbsp; Jezebel also warned that the death knights serving the Dark Queen
would get stronger as each day passed, but that the group would find aid in the most unlikely of places. Jezebel
gave her blessing to the brave adventurers and urged them to help drive away the Dark Queen.&nbsp; With this the
quest band went off to prepare for the coming darkness.</P>
<P>The war against the Dark Queen escalated as the Arch Vampire took arms against her.&nbsp; Realizing that she
would subjugate all who lived in the realm, the Arch Vampire chose to help fight her forces attacking the Dwarven
Mines.&nbsp; His stand proved to be futile though and ended with the Bishop of Thrombul sending the Arch Vampire
to safety before he himself was captured.&nbsp; The quest band under the leadership of Tandth, quickly responded
by assaulting the mines.&nbsp; They were quickly greeted by a large red dragon.&nbsp; The battle against this dragon
was fierce, for he was much greater than the dragons they had fought before.&nbsp; After a hard-fought victory,
the group managed to clear a path into the mines.&nbsp; Hordes of death knights barred the way to the Bishop.&nbsp;
Hearing his cries for help, the quest band fought their way to where he was being held by Kylishra the ice dragon
and another mighty red dragon.&nbsp; Tandth in a fit of heroics rushed in and snatched the Bishop from the ground.&nbsp;
Amidst a storm of fire and frost, Tandth managed to escape out of the room.&nbsp; Angry at this turn of events,
the dragons turned on each other, and Kylishra slew the red dragon.&nbsp; With the timely arrival of arch-pope
Sidartha, the quest band was able to drive away Kylishra in her weakened state.&nbsp; While the group recuperated
though, Kylishra returned with a vengeance and trapped the Bishop of Thrombul in his own bedroom.&nbsp; The quest
band fought one last grisly battle against the evil dragon and finally managed to slay it.&nbsp; On the corpse,
the group found the Axe of Dwarvish Lords, which Kylishra had been keeping from the dwarven people.&nbsp; The Bishop
gave his thanks and then showed the quest band notes he had managed to find in an ancient book of his.&nbsp; He
told the quest band of the death knights connection to the growing evil, and how the Arch Vampire must be sought
out for prophecy declared that he would help defeat the evil.&nbsp; The Bishop revealed that he had teleported
the Arch Vampire to Lion Heart and put him in care of the Gibbet Gang for that would be the last place the Dark
Queen would look. Knowing that they had no time to lose, the quest band quickly left the mines in search of the
Arch Vampire.</P>
<P>Despite the careful planning of the Bishop of Thrombul, the Dark Queen received word of the Arch Vampires location
and quickly sent a force to Lion Heart to capture him.&nbsp; Many of the evil minions of Lion Heart rose to do
the Dark Queens will.&nbsp; They were no match for the quest band though. The mighty Tandth summoned the ghouls
in Lion Heart and the group dealt death to them one by one.&nbsp; Major Oak confronted the group but fell before
the fiery lava of the Archmage.&nbsp; Though the death knights were even stronger than before, Arch-pope Warluk
called down the very lightning from the sky to destroy them.&nbsp; The evil necromancer of Arynn was also among
the ones that were to fall that night.&nbsp; The final battle against a great black dragon ended in a stalemate.&nbsp;
Some of the quest band fell to its lightning breath, but the dragon, not having found the Arch Vampire, left.&nbsp;
The quest band though searched diligently and found that the Arch Vampire had hidden with Yorick the Undead in
invisible form.&nbsp; A historical moment took place as the quest band and their long time enemy, the Arch Vampire,
met in peace for the first time.</P>
<P>The Arch Vampire told the quest band of his story.&nbsp; The Queen had been trying to destroy him for he was
one of her chief foes on this plane. He explained that he was no match for her for she was a goddess of a dark
realm, and only a supernatural force could aid in her defeat.&nbsp; It would be necessary to summon Tyrog, one
of the legendary first paladins, from the astral plane.&nbsp; To do this, the quest band would need to obtain two
objects, one of darkness and one of light.&nbsp; The object of darkness was a dark unholy shield, and the object
of light was the corpse of Therin Altair.&nbsp; The Arch Vampire revealed that he had been trying to obtain them
earlier when the quest band had thwarted him.&nbsp; The corpse could be found in a musty tomb among the saberfish
people.&nbsp; When these objects were found, they were to be placed in front of the memorial to Tyrog and the magic
words, &quot;alanothrot ethbod bethod dotheldenve&quot; must be uttered.&nbsp; The Arch Vampire warned that even
if the Dark Queen was defeated, her master Lyrel was still left to be defeated.&nbsp; Lyrel was the first of the
Dark Overlords, and was returning after having been banished by the forces of Shangry with the aid of arcane circles.&nbsp;
Lyrel had returned to this plane for vengeance, and the Dark Queen was one of his chief tools.&nbsp; The quest
band thanked the Arch Vampire then set out in search of the items to summon Tyrog.</P>
<P>Frustrated at the quest bands constant meddling, the Dark Queen turned her attentions to dealing with the thorn
in her side.&nbsp; With promises of power and wealth, the Dark Queen managed to turn fellow quest members against
each other.&nbsp; Under the leadership of Amakusa, Peel, Loki, and Crazed turned against the quest band while the
band was fighting death knights.&nbsp; Only Drentar, Oden, Eternity, and Lotus were there to fight the treachery
of the renegades.&nbsp; With the healing powers of Eternity and the powerful magic of Lotus, Drentar and Oden were
able to drive off the renegades.&nbsp; With Lotus being forced to help elsewhere, Drentar, Oden, and Eternity were
left alone to search for the items to summon Tyrog, until reinforcements could be found.&nbsp; Drentar, now leader
of the small band turned their hopes to the holy city of Brightmoon.&nbsp; There, Drentar learned that the unholy
artifact could be obtained by challenging Skrell the Gladiator.&nbsp; Quickly traveling to the arena, the quest
band managed to obtain the dark unholy shield by defeating Skrell in combat.&nbsp; The tide of battle turned upon
the return of the archmage and the great cleric-thief Albria, the cleric Rehman, and the mighty Ghomer.&nbsp; Seeing
the tide of battle turn, Crazed forsook the darkness and rejoined the Army of Light. Loki also switched sides but
agreed to become a spy for the quest group. Stronger now, Drentar led his band to the tomb of Therin Altair and
after great fighting, managed to obtain the corpse of Therin Altair.&nbsp; After placing the items before the memorial
to Tyrog, the quest band was confronted by the renegades.&nbsp; Amakusa fell to the power of Moaths magic, but
unfortunately Loki fell as well.&nbsp; Peel managed to survive the magical onslaught, but was no match for the
righteous fury of Albria as she slew him with her holy powers.&nbsp; The quest band then proceeded to Tyrogs tomb,
and the Archmage called forth Tyrog.&nbsp; Tyrog, came in his glory, and told the quest band that though he had
been summoned, the battle to defeat the Dark Queen would be long and hard.&nbsp; He told the band that the renegades
had been resurrected for their help would be needed in the coming turmoil. Tyrog revealed that the true gods were
returning, and that they too would aid the qauest band as much as they could.&nbsp; After a great moment of reconciliation,
the reunited quest band went off to find the Dark Queen while Tyrog raised the spirits of past Shangry warriors
to help do battle against the evil horde.</P>
<P>Despite the quest bands fortune at summoning Tyrog, the war against the Dark Queen began to shift in her favor.&nbsp;
The spirit of Jezebel Mallard was captured and she was banished from the plane.&nbsp; With Jezebel captured, the
Dark Queen was able to draw on her essence and enhance her powers.&nbsp; The quest band, desperate for an answer,
sought out Augustine the Proctor once more.&nbsp; Lord Augustine told the quest band to look to the heavens for
the battle ground, and that help would come in the form of Shangry warriors.&nbsp; Not knowing what to make of
this news, the quest band, now led by Drentar, sought out Alsafi the stargazer.&nbsp; Alsafi spoke of incredible
events in the heavens, that swarming hordes of flying death knights covered the sky like a plague of locust.&nbsp;
Alsafi explained that the death knights must be fought in the air now.&nbsp; The quest band was told to return
in two days for more information if they were successful.&nbsp; Along the way, the band faced evil driders and
other creatures.&nbsp; Finally reaching the Aerie, the one point where the realm of air dominated, the quest band
was greeted by a horde of death knights.&nbsp; A long battle ensued, with many people coming to the aid of the
band.&nbsp; Ferin a strong Shangry warrior, and Basher, a little ogre that just wanted to smash knights, both fell
in the battle against the death knights.&nbsp; The Arch Vampire then came in the bands hour of need and help crush
scores of death knights.&nbsp; Then the hordes fell back as the evil Ciottola the granite dragon came forth. The
Arch Vampire was driven back and the group was forced to battle yet another dragon.&nbsp; The granite dragon ravaged
everything in sight, but finally fell to the mighty quest band.&nbsp; Still, the horde of death knights swarmed
across the heavens, and the quest band was forced to fall back and regroup.</P>
<P>Just when the band thought all was lost, the Arch Vampire returned to lead them into battle.&nbsp; With the
help of the Arch Vampire, the quest band slaughtered huge numbers of death knights.&nbsp; Finally, the Dark Queen
herself intervened and did battle with the Arch Vampire.&nbsp; The Arch Vampire was stripped of his powers and
sent back into his crypt.&nbsp; Once more the quest band was at a loss.&nbsp; Then came Tyrog, hero of Shangry.&nbsp;
Knowing his time on this plane was short, Tyrog fought on till he was banished crushing scores upon scores of death
knights.&nbsp; Then in the darkest hour, aid came from the most unlikely of places.&nbsp; Lyrels half brother Telez
came.&nbsp; Using his arcane might, he managed to drive most of the remaining death knights away, before he too
was banished by the Dark Queens power. Despite the halt of the death knight swarm, the Dark Queen was far from
defeated.&nbsp; Calling on one of her most powerful minions, the Black Dragon was called to do battle with the
adventurers.&nbsp; Knowing that the quest band could not defeat the dragon, Albria prayed to the true gods for
aid.&nbsp; In answer to her prayers, Zelpth, god of paladins, awoke the mighty Gold Dragon from his slumber.&nbsp;
In a fierce battle, the gold dragon slew the black dragon and help turn the tide of battle.&nbsp; All her minions
finally defeated, the Dark Queen was forced to fight on her own.&nbsp; Using her formidable powers, she slew the
mighty gold dragon.&nbsp; Before he died though, the gold dragon cast a spell of enfeeblement upon the Dark Queen,
and with the aid of the god Zelpth, the Dark Queen was made susceptible to death by mortals.&nbsp; The Dark Queen
quickly went into hiding.&nbsp; Knowing there was no time to lose, the quest band sought out the aid of the Loremaster,
and learned that the Dark Queen hid among a cluster of trees.&nbsp; Wise Drentar took the band to the only cluster
of trees near the Aerie, but could not figure out where she was hiding.&nbsp; Fulfilling Tyrogs prophecy, and gaining
reconciliation for betraying the quest group, the former renegade Crazed discovered a secret passage in the cluster
of trees that led to the lair of the Dark Queen.</P>
<P>In the final confrontation, Drentar, Tulkas, Moath, Albria, Bump, Oden, Rehman, Crazed and Geli faced the Dark
Queen. In a titanic battle of epic proportions, the quest band finally faced the Dark Queen.&nbsp; Spells shook
the foundation of the earth, and blades clashed, until finally the Dark Queen fell dead at the feet of the quest
band.&nbsp; Then came Zelpth, one of the true gods.&nbsp; He told the quest band that they had won a great victory
that day, but the greater battle was yet to be fought.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lyrel, first dark overlord had returned to this
plane, and his power would have to be defeated before peace could be restored to the realm.&nbsp; Knowing that
the war against the darkness was far from over, the quest band left for Grimhaven to rest and prepare for the final
confrontation.&nbsp; As if a good omen for the future, the quest band received a vision of a freed Galek clasping
a tearful Jezebel in a warm embrace.&nbsp; The darkness had not been defeated, but a blow for good had been struck
that day.</P>

<H3>The Rise of Lyrel:</H3>
<H5><I>This Chronicle details the final battle against the dark forces brought about in the Age of Dragons and
the rise and fall of the Dark Overlord Lyrel.&nbsp; Many adventurers took up arms in this final conflict.&nbsp;
Of note are Drentar, Albria,&nbsp; Warluk, Hopper, Oden, Bump, Lotus, Oakk, Ghomer, Loki, Tulkas, Phoenyx, Amakusa,
Crumpler, Peel, Ishtar, Vesalius/Lou Barlow, Gloomer, Cypriana, Eternity, Atropos, Tandth, Crazed, Rehman, Alyria,
Ternoth, and myself the Archmage.</I></H5>
<P>With the fall of the Dark Queen, Lyrel began gathering an army to punish the foolish mortals who stood in his
path.&nbsp; Fortunately, the true gods had begun their return to the realm and were taking up the struggle against
Lyrel.&nbsp; Up till then, the knowledge of their return was only known by those who had help defeat the Dark Queen
earlier.&nbsp; Now, a great call had been sent out by the god Zelpth.&nbsp; Ogres, the race dearest to Zelpth,
were ordered to report to his altar.&nbsp; As all the ogres of the realm gathered before the altar of Zelpth, Tulavar,
one of his greatest clerics revealed his gods wishes.&nbsp; Zelpth revealed that the seal that had kept Lyrel from
this plane of existence had been broken.&nbsp; An ogre patient explained how he had been wounded hunting for the
pieces of the seal.&nbsp; He managed to learn that the seal had been broken into 4 sections.&nbsp; A great argument
ensued over this news.&nbsp; An ogre supervisor urged the ogres to take up arms to do battle against Lyrel.&nbsp;
He held no stock in gods and did not believe in the return of Zelpth.&nbsp; Horgan the ogre magius explained that
the seal had been broken when the lesser dark overlords had crept back into the lands. Horgan explained that Alsafi
the stargazer might know more.&nbsp; Tulavar went on to warn that Lyrel s power was growing rapidly and that Zelpth
and the other true gods were taking refuge at the moment.&nbsp; Tulavar warned all at the council to go forth and
tell people not to directly challenge Lyrels might they would be struck down.&nbsp; At the end of the council,
the mighty Ghomer was selected as the chosen one to bring this news back to the quest band under the leadership
of Drentar.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Despite the warning, many people challenged the might of Lyrel and his powers were revealed.&nbsp; Among those
struck down were the mighty Ghomer who suffered the loss of knowledge and experience, and a mighty spell of silence
was cast on the Realm.&nbsp; Despite this set back, the quest band made its way to Alsafi the stargazer who told
the group that the Gold dragon, who had been resurrected by Zelpth, could aid in their search for the seal pieces.&nbsp;
The Gold dragon welcomed back the brave band and agreed to help them once more.&nbsp; First, he removed the silence
spell around them .&nbsp; The Gold dragon then cast a mighty scrying spell to track the 4 pieces of the seal.&nbsp;
The dragon revealed that they had been scattered on the wind.&nbsp; The dragon did manage to trace one to the area
of Grimhaven, and two others to the southwest of Grimhaven.&nbsp; The dragon explained that when the quest band
had obtained the three pieces, they should return so that the dragon could use them to help discover the location
of the final piece.&nbsp; Knowing this, the quest band hurried back to Grimhaven.</P>
<P>All the people of Grimhaven were called together to aid in the search.&nbsp; Not knowing where to begin, the
search effort was greatly eased by a vision received by Peel.&nbsp; The quest band were given a clue, &quot;What
a fool thing to do, as you sit and ponder who, might have it brought, in pieces sought, In his foul mood he sits
scorned, by those whos yellow hide he regrets and shames.&quot;&nbsp; The quest band believed that this meant that
an ogre of some sort held the first piece of the seal, and a city-wide search was begun.&nbsp; It became a race
against time as Lyrel sent his own minions to hunt down this mysterious ogre.&nbsp; In the end, the wise Tulkas
managed to discover the whereabouts of the first seal piece.&nbsp; A Cult irregular had been hoarding a piece of
the seal as some valuable treasure in his bunk. Upon discovering that the quest band had found a seal piece, Lyrel
sent one of his trusted warriors, known as a doom guard.&nbsp; The doom guard attacked the quest band in an attempt
to steal the seal piece, but was defeated.</P>
<P>Knowing that time was of the essence, the quest band split up to search for the next two pieces of the seal.&nbsp;
It was Ghomer the chosen one of the ogres who managed to discover the whereabouts of the second piece. Some trolls
had found a piece of the seal and had given it to the troll king who had made it his most prized treasure.&nbsp;
Quickly regrouping, the quest band assaulted the troll caves and seized the second seal piece from the troll king.&nbsp;
This time, an even stronger doom guard came to do battle with the quest band.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a hard fought battle,
the quest band emerged from the troll caves victorious.&nbsp; It was then that scouts reported activity in Brazzad-dum.&nbsp;
It appeared that Lyrel, knowing that he only needed a single piece of the seal to be victorious, sent doom guards
to seize another piece while the quest band was in the troll caves. Fortunately, the fierce Shracknir defeated
the force of doom guards. Knowing now where the third piece of the seal was, the adventurers made their way to
the realm of Brazzad-dum.&nbsp; Along the way, the god Zelpth gifted the group with special lances to help battle
the dread Shracknir. Much to the bands happiness, the dragon was asleep and the dexterous Albria managed to steal
the third piece from Shracknir.&nbsp; Unfortunately before they could make their way to the protective custody
of the Gold dragon, Shracknir awoke in a fury and stole back the seal with magic. Knowing that Shracknir must be
confronted, the brave quest band attacked Shracknir with a fury.&nbsp; Moath the Archmage used spells of suffocation
to render the breath of Shracknir useless.&nbsp; Then the mighty blades of Crazed, Drentar, and Ghomer felled the
evil beast while the clerical spells of Lou Barlow and Eternity kept the brave band going.&nbsp; The remainder
of the quest band stood by in case reinforcements were needed.&nbsp; After a long drawn out battle, the adventurers
licked their wounds and then made their way back to the Gold dragon.&nbsp;</P>
<P>With the aid of the three seal pieces, the Gold dragon managed to determine that the last lay in the hands of
a cleric, and a vision of temple guards nearby was seen.&nbsp; The dragon then went on to warn them that he foresaw
Lyrel imprisoning everyone and that no would be able to physically leave.&nbsp; The group thanked the dragon for
the information and the news, and returned to Grimhaven to re-equip themselves after a long campaign.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Furious at being thwarted, Lyrel decided to keep the quest band from meddling any further.&nbsp; Calling forth
his power, Lyrel sealed all the cities in a binding force preventing anyone from leaving.&nbsp; The Gold dragons
prophecy came to pass and the cities once thought of as home became prisons of magic.&nbsp; It was quickly found
through the scouting efforts of Tandth and other citizens from other cities, that each city had been isolated from
the world.&nbsp; Each area had a sign that read &quot;These roads have been closed by the Order of Lyrel.&quot;&nbsp;
Knowing that the quest band was trapped, Lyrel raised up the dark overlords who fell in Shangry, and sent them
with wailing screechers to finish off the insubordinate mortals in Grimhaven.&nbsp; Together, Tandth, Crazed Ghomer,
Gloomer and Moath made a stand against them as the others of the quest band struggled to find a way out.&nbsp;
Though victorious against the task force sent against them, the quest band knew they had to hurry to complete the
seal.&nbsp; Already, the sun had turned black, and meteors struck the earth.&nbsp; Grimhaven was rocked by a series
of earthquakes.&nbsp; Rumors began that Raliki the evil seeded dragon of legend had been awakened by Lyrel.&nbsp;
Knowing that the last seal piece had to be found quickly, Tandth used the powers of his deity to transport the
quest band out of Grimhaven.&nbsp; After quick discussion, it was determined that the cleric they sought lay in
the watery world of Kalaysia.&nbsp; At first, the cleric would not surrender the final piece of the seal for Warluk
had offended her.&nbsp; Forced to do penance for the last seal piece, Warluk quickly went and got absolution.&nbsp;
Moath then sent Rehman under the power of a gills to flesh spell to persuade the cleric of Kalaysia to give up
the last seal piece.&nbsp; Understanding the urgency of the situation, the cleric gave the last seal piece to Rehman.&nbsp;
Having been told by the Gold dragon that only Fistandantilus could forge the seal back together, the adventurers
quickly made their way towards the Brightmoon area.&nbsp; Lyrel realizing that the seal pieces had been all gathered,
sent another force to stop them from reaching the forger.&nbsp; While Moath the Archmage presented the quest pieces
to Fistandantilus, Tandth was forced to hold off a force of blood spattered mutants and burning minotaurs.&nbsp;
Fistandantilus revealed that he could not forge the seal without two things.&nbsp; He would need coal from a special
blend of ore, and a runed hammer to do the forging.&nbsp; The clue given by Zelpth as to the whereabouts of the
runed hammer was &quot;Every cloud has a silver lining.&quot;&nbsp; Unfortunately most of the quest band were forced
to go elsewhere to help combat the forces of darkness plaguing the other cities, and Vesalius took up the leadership
with Ghomer, Warluk, and the Archmage at his side.&nbsp; They were forced to search for the runed hammer themselves.&nbsp;
At first, the group thought the hammer lay in Cimea.&nbsp; They were later joined there by Crumpler the fearsome
warrior.&nbsp; After battling more doomguards and possessed minions of Lyrel, the quest band discovered that the
hammer did not lay in Cimea.&nbsp; In a startling vision, Vesalius realized that the hammer was being held by Silubhra
the silver dragon.</P>
<P>The group made their way to Silverstone Falls and there were forced to fight against a huge force of doom guards
and other minions.&nbsp; After a desperate battle against this horde and a risky run to steal the hammer from Silubhra,
the quest band managed to escape from Silverstone Falls. Needing time to recover from wounds, Warluk and Moath
stayed behind in safety, and now Vesalius and Ghomer were forced to search for the last item needed to forge the
seal themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; Traveling to the Dwarven Mines, renowned for their great ore, Vesalius and Ghomer
searched for the special piece of ore needed by Fistandantilus.&nbsp; Extremely possessive of their ore, the dwarves
relentlessly attacked Vesalius and Ghomer, and a great fight ensued.&nbsp; After defeating the dwarves and freeing
the elven slaves,&nbsp; they found the special ore on the corpse of one of the elite guards.&nbsp; Successful in
their mission, they brought both the hammer and the ore back to Fistandantilus.&nbsp; Using the items, Fistandantilus
managed to reforge the seal of Lyrel into a great silver dish&nbsp; He then imparted the knowledge that the seal
would only work if the quest band managed to lure Lyrel back to the pit from whence he came and then used the seal
to keep him there.&nbsp;</P>
<P>With the seal reconstructed, the power of Lyrel began to suffer. Before being slain in a massive tidal wave,
the Bishop of Brightmoon managed to free his city from Lyrels imprisonment.&nbsp; The Head Mage of Grimhaven then
gathered his mages and together they freed the city from Lyrel.&nbsp; With each city being returned to normal,
Lyrels grasp on the others waned.&nbsp; The parish priest of Waterford freed the shire folk.&nbsp; A mighty dwarven
priest freed the Dwarven Mines.&nbsp; The royal court of Amber pooled their power together and freed their beloved
city.&nbsp; One by one, the cities were freed.</P>
<P>Now beginning to fear the quest band with the reforged seal, Lyrel decided to take some of the citizens of Grimhaven
hostage.&nbsp; Hearing of this dread news, the quest band gathered its members back together and headed out to
the badlands to rescue the hostages held by Lyrel.&nbsp; They were told to seek out Telez there for aid in their
quest.&nbsp; Knowing that they were no match for the massive force holding the badlands, the quest group, once
more under Drentar, tried to avoid fighting in their search for Telez and the hostages.&nbsp; Spotting a figure
resembling Telez, the group stopped to ask his help.&nbsp; The man asked to see the seal.&nbsp; Upon giving him
the seal, it was revealed that it was not Telez but an impostor.&nbsp; Upon hearing that the seal had been taken,
Lyrel released the hostages.&nbsp; Not knowing what else to do, the quest band sought out the real Telez.&nbsp;
Telez told the band that they should seek out Tulavar once more to gain guidance from Zelpth.&nbsp; It was then
that Ramislif, god of neutrality returned.&nbsp; The Beholder of Worlds explained to the quest band that they would
need the four artifacts of light to combat the growing evil.&nbsp; From the clouds came a great light, and the
two shields of pure light were presented before the band by Zelpth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramislif then bestowed his powerful
staff to the Archmage, and bade the quest group to find the last artifact of light.&nbsp; Empowered by the blessings
of Zelpth and Ramislif, the quest group traveled to meet Tulavar. At the same time, a messege from the amazon nation
reached the quest group, and the fair Albria was asked to come before them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bidding farewell
to her quest companions, Albria heeded the call.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Upon reaching Tulavar, the quest band found him in discussion with a doom guard.&nbsp; In Tulavars hands was
the Seal of Lyrel.&nbsp; Apparently the treacherous priest has sent one of his agents to steal it from the quest
group.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tulavar explained that he could not believe that Zelpth would forsake his children and place
his trust in saving the world to humans and other races.&nbsp; Tulavar decided that he would avenge this wrong
by his god by delivering the seal to Lyrel and banishing Zelpth from the world. Outraged at this treachery, the
quest band fell upon Tulavar and the doom guard, but Tulavar managed to escape in the struggle.&nbsp; Knowing there
was no time to lose, Moath called upon his power and tracked down the traitor Tulavar.&nbsp; Just as Tulavar was
beginning a ritual to break the Seal of Lyrel, Moath used his magic to stop him.&nbsp; A short but fierce fight
ensued, and Tulavar fell before the might of the Archmage.&nbsp; With the seal recovered, Moath returned to find
that the quest band had dealt death to the conspiring doom guard.&nbsp; Seeing the recovery of the seal, Zelpth
came to them once more and commended them.&nbsp; He then presented them with mystic bardic patches that would help
them fight &quot;against the allures of death.&quot; Having fallen once before to the evil charms of Lyrels minions,
these special patches would allow the quest band to be resistant to the foul charms of Lyrels minions.&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the doom guard did not return with the Seal of Lyrel, Lyrel realized that the quest band, the constant
thorn in his side, had once more prevailed.&nbsp; Tired of playing with the mortals, the full power of Lyrel was
revealed.&nbsp; In a fit of rage, Lyrel banished Zelpth and Ramislif from this plane.&nbsp; He then resurrected
the Dark Queen, and brought forth Raliki the evil seeded dragon to do her bidding.&nbsp; This tremendous expenditure
of power ripped a hole in the very fabric of the prime material plane, and a portal into the Abyss was created
above the skies of Grimhaven.&nbsp; Knowing that the forces of the Abyss would soon be unleashed upon the innocent
folk of Grimhaven, the quest band knew that they had to make a stand. Equipping for the long fight ahead, the quest
band gathered what supplies they could for the dread confrontation ahead of them.&nbsp; Those who were to brave
the dread horrors of the abyss were Ghomer, Ishtar, Oakk, Warluk, Cypriana, Bump, Hopper, Oden, Cypriana, Atropos,
Eternity, Drentar the leader of the brave band, and of course myself the Archmage.&nbsp; As if sent by the true
gods themselves, it was then that Albria returned from the amazon nation.&nbsp; With her was the Amazonian breastplate,
the final artifact of light.&nbsp; Heartened by this good omen, the quest band entered the Abyss. In this dark
realm, all of the Queens minions fought for her.&nbsp; The quest band was faced by armies of death knights, doom
guards, and evil wizards. Foul beings such as the Unmaker rose to do her bidding as well.&nbsp; Amidst a hail of
lightning bolts,&nbsp; fireballs, and frost, the mighty quest group led by Drentar carved a path of blood through
the Dark Queens minions, until finally they stood before her.&nbsp; A mighty battle ensued between the quest band
and the Dark Queen with her evil dragon Raliki.&nbsp; Both sides traded fire, spells, and blows for many hours.&nbsp;
The quest band was eventually forced to fall back, but not before wounding Raliki enough to force him to leave
his queen to her own devices.&nbsp; While regrouping, it was remembered that the Dark Queen was susceptible to
the powers of the earth.&nbsp; Realizing her one great weakness, the quest group attacked once more with renewed
vigor.&nbsp; With the aid of powerful earth magic, the Dark Queen was once more vanquished.</P>
<P>Seeing the demise of his beloved Dark Queen, Lyrel decided to finally deal with the &quot;insolent mortals&quot;
himself.&nbsp; Taking on a corporeal form, Lyrel descended into the Abyss to do battle with the adventurers.&nbsp;
It was then that Ramislif and Zelpth combined their powers to send a message across the planes.&nbsp; It was revealed
that the Abyss was the home plane of Lyrel and that if he was defeated here, it would be possible to seal him in
the Abyss.&nbsp; The quest band knew this was their only chance, for Lyrel being immortal, could never be destroyed
by mortal hands.&nbsp; In a great battle, Lyrel finally met those who had opposed him for so long.&nbsp; The epic
battle that ensued rocked the Abyss in its fury.&nbsp; Lightning and fire lit up the streets of Grimhaven as energy
poured from the portal into the Abyss.&nbsp; The Abyss and the very earth rocked with great force as Lyrels dark
power was met by the holy prayers and mighty spells of&nbsp; the quest band.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lyrels mighty blows were
blocked and countered by the cold steel of the brave adventurers.&nbsp; Finally, the massive form of Lyrel fell
before the feet of the group.&nbsp; As the group were celebrating though, the flesh of Lyrel was reforming, and
his chest began to rise and fall once more.&nbsp; His immortal nature was restoring him to full strength.&nbsp;
In a matter of minutes, Lyrel would be as healthy as when he had started the fight.&nbsp; With the group exhausted
from combat, they knew that they would have to seal the Abyss now.&nbsp; Racing across the ethereal surface of
the Abyss, the quest band hurried to seal the portal to the Abyss.&nbsp; Nearing the portal, the quest band heard
the thunderous shout of Lyrel as he rose fully restored.</P>
<P>Reaching the entrance to the portal, the quest band stepped to the other side as Moath set the seal down before
the gaping fissure.&nbsp; Realizing his grave mistake, Lyrel raced to leave the Abyss before he would become imprisoned.&nbsp;
As the sound of the&nbsp; thunderous footsteps of Lyrel neared, Moath shouted the arcane words that would once
more seal the Abyss, &quot;alanothrot ethbod bethod dotheldenve.&quot;&nbsp; Just as the great form of Lyrel came
into view, the seal began to close the fissure.&nbsp; With a great sucking force, the fissure into the Abyss began
to fall in upon itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The quest group and Lyrel were thrown back as a mighty explosion of light came
forth from the closing fissure.&nbsp; Then the air and light seemed to be sucked into the rapidly closing hole.&nbsp;
Then everything went dark.&nbsp; When the quest band could see again, they were once more in the center square
of Grimhaven.&nbsp; Peace had settled over the land and all was quiet.&nbsp; The war had ended and Lyrel was once
more imprisoned in the Abyss.&nbsp;&nbsp; The exhausted group was then taken into the blessed realm of Zelpth and
Ramislif.&nbsp; Though no one except the quest group truly knows what occurred in that holy place, the adventurers
returned changed and renewed with life.&nbsp; To this day, those who stood with the gods, still walk the realm.
Warluk, Oden, Oakk, Albria, Cypriana, Eternity, Hopper, Atropos, Drentar, and Moath came back blessed as Warriors
of Shangry, in honor of those first warriors who drove Lyrel from this realm.&nbsp; Many of the other adventurers
who were not in the final stand against Lyrel also received the blessing of the true gods.&nbsp; Though the Dark
Time has passed, many still bear the scars of this great quest.&nbsp; The Realm now stands poised on the beginning
of a new age.&nbsp; Only the future can tell what awaits the brave adventurers that reside with the Realm.</P>
