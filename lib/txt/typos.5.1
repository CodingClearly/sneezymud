not sure if its all the ice commanders quests (for ice) that are missing a check for limited eq but... the small ice dagger are way over the max, and there  from trading food to goblin-giggling -> give the ice to ice commander pretty simple quest when all


 you have to do is walk around, and at 5k a dagger that adds up.

A small crow chirps noisily at Alexandre, and flaps his wings menicingly.  I'm Alexandre, so I think the message should use 'you' instead of 'Alexandre'? Also, it's "menacingly," I believe.  Alexandre.

Subject: Dark Ant Tunnels 
  The walls, floor, and low ceiling here are made of chunks of loose dirt. The tunnel is round in shape rather than square like most normal constructions, which makes it somewhat difficult to walk, although the soft nature of the floor aids in stabilizing your steps.  The darkness, bizarreness, and uniform nature of this tunnel system is confusing and you are easily lost and disoriented.
