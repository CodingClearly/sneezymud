<p align="left">
Here you may find the histories and views expressed by the major factions of SneezyMUD.  Please note
these volumes are the work of their respective factions and do not necessarily represent truth.  Also,
the texts have been directly transcribed from their in-game counterparts and may therefore include
some parsing problems. If you wish to submit a text for the faction histories archive, feel free to
email the <a href="mailto:webmaster@sneezy.saw.net">SneezyMUD Webmaster</a>, detailing your request.
