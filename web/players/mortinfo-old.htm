Jeff Ruebel. </a> Jeff is currently a Computer Science major at Miami 
University, but is originaly from Cincinnati where he MUDs with friends 
KingTurtle, Ehlana, and MoonDancer as well as others. Jeff is also an 
aspiring SF author, plays electric guitar, and loves to listen to his vast 
CD collection while playing Sneezy. He was also probably the first Cincinnati 
resident to play Sneezy when he wandered on to UC's library gopher one year 
during high school. The rest of the gang was soon to follow. Currently, Jeff 
is either trying to get his homepage to work for more than 2 seconds, or just 
bugging Mithros.

<A NAME = "grgich">
<HR>
<LI><I> Grgich </I> is played by Scott Murphy.  Scote writes, <P>
<UL>
After graduating from SDSU with a BS in Business Admin, accounting to be
exact, I was overwhelmed with the fear that I may become trapped in a suit
with a tight fitting tie, listening to the endless buzz of florescent
lighting. I therefore chose a different path. Restaurant Management of
course. A burn out career to be sure, but I did get to experience
different parts of the country and consequently fell in love with the
Pacific N.W. <P>

Now a retired, burned out, restaurant manager, I am a server and banquet
captain for the Chart House in Portland, OR. This has driven my wife
completly over the edge as she works days and I nights, but what the hell.
This allows me to play Sneezy all hours of the day and night while I await
some type of desire to rejoin the professional life style that would make
my wife jump for joy. Hope she is patient as it's only been two years. <P>

As for my current character Grgich, he was born out of fine red wine and
hours of attempts and failures. His predecessors date back to Sneezy 3.1
and include Badger, Glacier, Massgravity and Caymus. Only Caymus still
makes an occasional appearance and that may not be for much longer. Gone
are all the trappings of elaborate warriors, leaving only the true rush
obtained by beating one's foe to death with bare hands. <P>

So, as you view the weather channel late one evening and notice that the
upper left corner of the U.S. fighting off a large, snow filled storm,
listen closely to your TV and you just may hear the maddening cackle of a
burned out restaurant manager as he continues to tear limb from limb all
whom confront him. eheheh!>

<a name = "kingturtle">
<HR>
<li> "One of the most powerful *cough* warriors in all the land of SneezyMUD,
<i> KingTurtle </i> is played by <a href = "./images/joe.jpg"> Joe 
Steinbrunner </a>  He has been playing since the 3.0 release and has 
enjoyed it ever since.  The only problem he sees with the MUD is that 
it is so addictive, which is why he is only an average student.  He 
played the tuba at Indian Hill High School, located in Cincinnati, Ohio, 
and is currently attending the University of Cincinnati majoring in 
computer science.  Some of his other activites include part time network 
administration at his old school district, & assisting in Indian Hill's 
Marching Band performance setups.  You can reach his homepage at

<a name = "midnight">
<HR>
<li><A HREF="./images/dawn.jpg"><I> Midnight/Seraphim </I></A>, originally found on 3.1 as Draganav/Lasher, is a 
business student at LDSBC in Salt Lake City, Utah.  When she isn't 
mudding, she can be found playing twister, attempting to fly kites in 
wooded areas, and learning to mail goldfish without crushing them.  When 
she IS mudding, she can be found playing twister, attempting to fly in 
confined areas and learning to crush things on purpose.  She was 
originally brought to sneezy by Ballan, and was later taught by the 
mighty Knight Vangard, who's most important lessons to date have been that 
there are THREE things that the letter "K" can make you do when abbreviated,
and most importantly, to ENDURE TO THE END!  
<P>

<a name = "moondancer">
<HR>
<li> <i> MoonDancer </i> who is played by <A HREF="./images/moon.jpg"> Rachael Lipka, </A> is a long time Sneezyite.  She started Sneezy on 2.4 where she played Tika (not to be confused with the Tika on 3.0) and has stayed with it all the way through 4.0. 
 A freshman at the College of Charleston in South Carolina, Rachael is
pursuing a degree in Marine Biology. <P>

Midevil fantasy is one of her favorite interests.  She is even known to 
show up at the Ohio Rennisance Festival in complete costume!  Her other 
interests include Marching Band (color guard), Tae Known Do, and riding horses. <P>

MoonDancer reflects Rachael's real life personality. She is a girl who 
loves to have fun!  She is always laughing and when she is not laughing she 
is giggling.  There is nothing that she will let stand in her way when it 
comes to having a good time. (except for maybe a few crazed gladiators).

<A NAME = "sin">
<HR>
<LI><i> Sin </i> is played by Cornell biology major Rob Tapella.  Rob was 
dragged into playing Sneezy by the infamous Vangard (Holy Knight of Ukko) in
September 1994.  After fooling around with a few newbie characters (and
getting them killed by grouping with Van), he settled on an antipaladin
(who still died when grouped with Van).  Sin managed to obtain the Life
Leech spell, and use it about three times before the azora site was
lost.  Rob likes Macs, guitar, and industrial music (particularly Skinny
Puppy).  He used to do stuff like running, swimming, and baseball, but
seems to be in his 'lazy stage.'  Sin's homepage can be found <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/rtapella/"> here. </A>

<li><center> CHILDREN OF SNEEZY </center><p>

<dd> I have retured from an extended call by my God.  Though I 
serve him still I am no longer outside the realms of mortal
communications.  My name is Vangard The Holy Knight of Ukko, a
humble servant of my God.  For years I have wandered this noble
world.  War, Greed and Evil meet together in everlasting struggle
with Love, Friendship, and the true power of Good!  My quest is
simple...While striving to free myself from the bonds of a carnal
mind and reach exaltation to help as many others attain the same
as would follow.

<dd> 3 years ago I remember my first quest.  The honorable Michelob
led the expedition.  A young man I foolishly followed and began a
career that encompassed both myself and those I loved.  Years
later (50 + days play time in 3.1 alone) I have been on quests to
solo the Arch Vampire, Saved my homeland from the threat of
Tylon's (forgive misspelling) invasion, halted the encoachins
Drow and Kobold armies, recieved high honors in the first world
tournement under the guidence of my lord Cosmo and to the dismay
of my nemisis counterponent Sticks (hehe), and many other
activities arraged by the heavens rageing from nightgowns to
furballs.  I remember teching a young acolyte named Biblethumper
how to hold my Banded mail boots, a sin long since repented for
but humorous none the less.  I also recall the ringing in my
Jewled Helm caused by the hardest head I know...Darkannan.  With
the leadership of the mighty Knight Huma we built a mighty
brotherhood that stood strongly against the evil of the
adversary.  I was continualy guided by the unfailing spirits of
Jedi and Lancelot, and will never forget thier love for me. Nor
will the memory of my first tutors Azor or Lothar *shiver* ever
escape my memory or prayers.  Slowly I brought my
friends...Heimdall, Midnight (and whatever her thousands of
others characters may be) Syidan, Darkalith, and my best friend
and misguided brother Sin.  I fell in love once which brought on
a civil war and several setbacks.  Left standing at the altar I
continued to salve a wounded heart.

<dd> My journey nearly complete (level 46), a full set of engraved
jeweled armor, a +5 Holy Avenger named Rusty (+13 +15 at my
height), I never forgot my God....I departed so close and yet
with much to learn.  I pray he would grant me with the strength
to complete his will. <p>

In closing a favorite scripture of mine: <p><i>

<dd> And it came to pass that [Vangard] rent his coat; and took a
piece thereof, and wrote upon it-in memory of our God, our
religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our
children-and he fastened it upon the ends of a pole.
And he fastened on his Headplate, and his Breastplate, and his
shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the
pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called
it the title of Liberty) and he bowed himself to the Earth, and
he prayed mightily to his God for the blessings of liberty to
rest upon his bretheren.... 

<dd> And when [Vangard] had said these words, he went forth among the
people, waveing the rent part of his garment in the air, that all
might see the writing which he had written upon the rent part,
and crying with a loud voice, saying :

<dd> Behold, whosoever will maintain this title upon the land let
them come forth in the strength of the Lord, and enter into a
coventant that they will maintain thier rights, and thier
religion, that the LORD GOD MAY BLESS THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </i><p>
