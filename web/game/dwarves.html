      <h1 align="right">Dwarven Territorial Backgrounds</h1>
      <p>As you will learn, your character's characteristics are largely governed
by your racial selection.  Territorial selection serves as a modifier
on these natural stats.  So in essence, you are choosing a sub-race
here that will slightly offset the characteristics of your racial norm.
      <p>Territorial choice does NOT grant any additional skills within the
game.  However, some skills may be impacted directly or indirectly
by your choice of background.  The chief effect of territorial
choice is to modify your natural racial stats.&nbsp;
      <hr>
      <p><b>Urban</b>: A city dweller. You were born to a family that had left
      the traditional tribal lifestyle behind, and moved to an urban center.
      Your family was most likely involved in trade, or politics, and encouraged
      you to take advantage of the contact with other races, and the other
      benefits of civilization. You have become disassociated from the
      traditions of dwarven life, but have replaced them with the accouterments
      of city-life. </p>
      <p><b>Villager</b>: You have had an average dwarven upbringing, growing up
      in a mid-sized village. Life was fairly unremarkable. Access to both
      educational and medical facilities was possible, and you are well versed
      in the traditions of your people. </p>
      <p><b>Hill</b> <b>Dwarf</b>: You were born in a small, dwarven mining
      village that worked the surrounding hillsides for their mineral contents.
      There were few other civilized outposts nearby, so contact was somewhat
      limited, yet your solid dwarven upbringing kept you from becoming bored
      (mostly by keeping focused on gold, beer, gold, and gold). </p>
      <p><b>Mountain</b> <b>Dwarf</b>: Your family was incredibly fortunate,
      having discovered a large mineral vein that would not run out for many
      years, and you and your family had been working it throughout your entire
      upbringing. The work was as rigorous as it was remote, but from it you
      learned the finer points of dwarven mining techniques. </p>
      <p><b>Recluse</b>: Your family had been ostracized from normal dwarven
      society, and raised you on the fringes of civilization. Due to their
      shame, you seldom met anyone but your immediate family, and had little
      contact with others. This taught you to be highly self-reliant, and
      equally self-confident. </p>
      <hr>
      <p>&nbsp;Most dwarven tribes are civilized, although a small number have
      shunned contact with the Civilized Races, and are thus regarded as wild
      tribes. Wild tribes often differ in characteristics from those of their
      civilized brethren due to long-time genetic inbreeding (and in some cases,
      cross-breeding with other wild races). Wild dwarf tribes vary in
      disposition and characteristic, some are merely xenophobic, while others
      have allied with dark forces and are fundamentally opposed to the
      existence of all of civilization. Some wild tribes are such just because
      of political due to their location.</p>
      <p>The Duergar tribes are the most notable amongst the wild tribes. Little
      is known about this reclusive society, and contact with them is often
      dangerous.</p>
      <p>Players are not permitted to play members of the wild races due to the
      fact that they would be unwelcome within the bounds of civilization.
