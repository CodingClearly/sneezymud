SneezyMUD has a special feature in which mobs will, from time to time,
attempt to "re-possess" an item which once belonged to them.  Such creatures
are affectionately referred to as hunters.  This is a semi-random function
triggered automatically when certain conditions have been met and was 
instituted to insure a fair and equitable turnover of equipment should some
high powered item fall into a newbies hands.  If you are powerful enough, just
re-kill the creature, otherwise, be creative and try to escape.
