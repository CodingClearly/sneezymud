			***************************************************** <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 1<BR>
			<BR>
			1. Oh ye fair ones, how could ye have departed <BR>
			from the ways of Galek! <BR>
			O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected<BR>
			he who stood with open arms to receive you! <BR>
			Behold, if ye had not done this ye would not have fallen. <BR>
			But behold, ye are fallen, and I mourn your loss. <BR>
			2. My soul is rent in anguish, <BR>
			because of the slain of our people. <BR>
			Oh ye fair sons and daughters, <BR>
			ye husbands and wives, ye fair ones, <BR>
			How is it that ye could have fallen! <BR>
			But behold, ye are gone, <BR>
			and my sorrows can not bring your return. <BR>
			<BR>
			3. Yea, now because of my injuries I must soon go down <BR>
			to my grave, and my spirit to those that gave me life. <BR>
			4. Oh that ye might remember the words of your Prophet. <BR>
			Oh that ye may never forget his gift to you. <BR>
			5. In the days of my youth I remember sitting at his feet<BR>
			listening to the wisdom and love embodied in his teachings. <BR>
			6. Verily he taught us whence we came, our noble birthright! <BR>
			Indeed he founded our belief in the Great Creator of The World. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 2<BR>
			<BR>
			1. In those days we lived in peace. <BR>
			Even those wicked Logrites who sought to oppress <BR>
			and sit upon their thrones in decadence<BR>
			were encompassed in his love<BR>
			and given freedom to worship as they saw fit <BR>
			the filthy lucre of The World. <BR>
			2. Yea he said, <BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;For verily verily I say unto you, <BR>
			it is given to all men that they might choose for themselves, <BR>
			whether it be morality and virtue or the pain of greed. <BR>
			I exhort you my brethren, be honest, true, chaste, benevolent <BR>
			and do good to all men.&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Galek has given us those commandments to teach us the truth, <BR>
			and to prepare us for that day when we might return home. <BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;The worth of the individual is great in mine eyes. <BR>
			For all mankind has a common creator and innate glory. <BR>
			Each of us is endowed with wisdom and personal responsibility <BR>
			or the welfare of ourselves and others. <BR>
			our conquers our carnal desires to limit personal freedoms <BR>
			and the agency of one another. <BR>
			Oh that I could teach you this one principle, <BR>
			that the purpose of ones life is discovered only in the losing of it. <BR>
			Learn to serve one another in whatever manner possible. <BR>
			Then you will realize that when ye are in the service <BR>
			of your fellow man ye are only in the service of your creator.&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 3<BR>
			<BR>
			1. Those were days of beauty. <BR>
			2. Now there are only the fallen bodies of the Noble Guardians. <BR>
			Perhaps their sacrifice has been the greatest of all. <BR>
			For they truly fought for freedom. <BR>
			3. Yea they truly fought to liberate our friends the Tytans<BR>
			from the bondage of slavery. <BR>
			4. Behold! they sacrificed their lives for another. <BR>
			5. Oh that I could smite down that foul city <BR>
			with the rod of my masters word. <BR>
			6. Alas, I must soon return to the dust of the ground, <BR>
			however, I will not forget Frarin Falls <BR>
			as long as my soul continues to exist. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 4<BR>
			<BR>
			1. I can remember the morning Dagendar<BR>
			came bleeding to the gates of Brightmoon, <BR>
			for thus was our noble stronghold named. <BR>
			2. His wounds were severe and were<BR>
			it not for the swift aid of our clerics<BR>
			I fear he too would have perished. <BR>
			3. The suffering he detailed was appalling. <BR>
			4. The Guardian of the Steps was up in arms almost immedietly<BR>
			gathering his troops for our first offensive upon the forces of Logrus. <BR>
			<BR>
			5. The words of the prophet fell upon deaf ears<BR>
			as the Paladin guards assembled before the Cathedral. <BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;For it cometh to pass that whosoever buildeth up <BR>
			secret combinations to overthrow <BR>
			the freedom of all lands, nations and countries; <BR>
			and seeketh to bring destruction upon all races, <BR>
			the same is built up by Logrus, who is the father of all lies; <BR>
			even that same liar who beguiled our brethren a century ago, <BR>
			yea even that same liar who has caused Man <BR>
			to commit murder and subjugate one another, <BR>
			and hath hardened their hearts to truth! <BR>
			Yes, Galek has taught us that we must respect another's wishes, <BR>
			that they mayest respect ours, <BR>
			but I say unto you he hath also said <BR>
			we must eliminate oppression! <BR>
			We must free these souls from slavery. <BR>
			If we do not we are not worthy of the title Knight, <BR>
			nor is it permissible that we bear the name of a Galekian. <BR>
			Men I pray thee, gather together thy strength <BR>
			and follow me to victory!&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Yea, and so it was said by the commander Melchizedek. <BR>
			6. Much to the dismay of our Prophet the people of Brightmoon<BR>
			were united behind our leader and Defender of the Steps. <BR>
			Their hearts were full of rage despite his attempts to calm them. <BR>
			In the end he was quieted by chants of freedom<BR>
			and saw that this must be. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 5<BR>
			<BR>
			1. Now he is gone. I fear that we are as well. <BR>
			2. Yea, we have unleashed through our anger<BR>
			an even greater evil, the spawn of hell itself. <BR>
			3. I know not what manner of Deamon<BR>
			has vanquished our Prophet, <BR>
			but his ruthlessness was enough to overcome <BR>
			even his desperate summoner Logrus. <BR>
			4. Oh ye fair ones; <BR>
			Ye Knights of Galek; <BR>
			How could ye have departed? <BR>
			
			<H3>The Book of Endralil</H3>
			<P><BR>
			***************************************************** <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 1<BR>
			<BR>
			1. In the 4th year of the reign of the Prophets<BR>
			I was commissioned by my dying uncle, Morianton the Seer<BR>
			to continue the record of my people upon these sacred scrolls. <BR>
			2. I being only 14 and new to such things, <BR>
			knew nothing save it were given me by the hands of deity. <BR>
			3. In my weakness I pray that this record be made strong<BR>
			by their hands and carry wisdom to<BR>
			many future generations of Knights. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 2<BR>
			<BR>
			1. My first memory is that of Brightmoon fields. <BR>
			Their lofty scarecrows made perfect targets<BR>
			for our Lances and Heavy Vindicators. <BR>
			2. I being but a boy squire kept secret my calling<BR>
			in order to more easily preserve these scriptures. <BR>
			3. For many false prophets have arisen<BR>
			to corrupt and defame the sacred words of Galek<BR>
			and dilute his teachings. <BR>
			4. I know that only through this true and honest journal<BR>
			may all things be restored by a righteous seer<BR>
			1 millennia after the coming of the first<BR>
			for thus has it been spoken unto me. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 3<BR>
			<BR>
			1. Now I begin to give an account<BR>
			of the occurrences hereafter among the Holy Order. <BR>
			2. In the days where many of our Fathers and older brethren<BR>
			had been slain due to their valor in combat<BR>
			and idealistic tenacity, even unto the laying down of their own lives. <BR>
			I witnessed a great confusion within the Order. <BR>
			3. In so much that it become necessary to form a<BR>
			organizational structure<BR>
			to preserve our beliefs, <BR>
			where hitherto the sole spirit of commradery sufficed. <BR>
			4. Many youth were dubbed Knights <BR>
			and Deacons in the Holy Order of Aaron, <BR>
			and thus for the first time was the <BR>
			Knighthood split into two bodies. <BR>
			5. This power and authority was given<BR>
			unto us as a preparatory state<BR>
			in which to learn and prove ourselves worthy of the fullness<BR>
			of the Knighthood of Melchizedek, named<BR>
			in honor of the first High Crusader<BR>
			and stalwart Guardian under Galek himself, <BR>
			to fall at the battle of Frarin Falls. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 4<BR>
			<BR>
			1. In these early years I did my duty collecting fast offerings<BR>
			and tithing funds amongst our people, for it became needful<BR>
			that we rebuild our once mighty surroundings<BR>
			with what little we possessed. <BR>
			2. For even our friends the Tytans could not protect us forever. <BR>
			No doubt before long the forces of Logrus would be at our gates<BR>
			seeking our extinction. For they have vowed in their wrath that, <BR>
			if it were possible, they would destroy our records and us, <BR>
			and also the traditions of our fathers. <BR>
			3. The Elders had formed a quorum of 12 counseling Apostles<BR>
			to the Guardian of the Steps, son of Melchizedek, Enochen of Normane.<BR>
			<BR>
			4. Though each of the 12 were given governing spheres<BR>
			over separate aspects of the Holy Order, it was Enochen<BR>
			that was Chief Commander and leader of the Knighthood. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 5<BR>
			<BR>
			1. Now Enochen was a Holy man, and strong in the faith of Galek. <BR>
			Even were all Knights like unto him the very foundations<BR>
			of those wretched ones would crumbled<BR>
			to the depths from whence they spewed. <BR>
			2. Verily he gave unto us much structure and divine truth. <BR>
			3. Yea he did say, <BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;For all Knights shall contribute 10% of all funds<BR>
			to the building up of Celestia! <BR>
			And prove me now if our Deities <BR>
			will not pour down blessings upon us <BR>
			in so much that there shall not be room enough to receive! <BR>
			<BR>
			4. Yea, I have a vision of dozens, <BR>
			Nay, hundreds of Temples and Cathedrals <BR>
			built in reverence to those powers <BR>
			that have preserved us in this land. <BR>
			5. For have we not seen a miracle indeed! <BR>
			<BR>
			Now I cry again; <BR>
			Have we not seen this miracle! <BR>
			The lines of trade are collapsing beneath the cultists, <BR>
			for indeed they shall be called as such, <BR>
			for they are they who do seek to destroy <BR>
			the freedom of souls and bind our eyes and hands <BR>
			with the strong cords of oppression. <BR>
			6. And why do they collapse? <BR>
			Yea, it is because of their greed and lust for power <BR>
			that warps theirs minds and clouds their souls! <BR>
			Those strange ones of Arcadia came as visitors. <BR>
			They have restored our trade routes, <BR>
			yet because of such industry and commerce <BR>
			the wanton eyes of that Vampyr grow in hate. <BR>
			7. Now is the time we must grow in strength my brethren. <BR>
			I ask you not to give because you have been given, <BR>
			no, nor because it is thy duty, <BR>
			but because of your faith which is in our Creator! <BR>
			8. Support those leaders that have been chosen to govern <BR>
			over the Knighthood <BR>
			with all your heart, might, mind and strength. <BR>
			9. Sustain them in all their doings <BR>
			and assist them in their callings. <BR>
			10. Let our sacrifices unite us into one family, under one truth! <BR>
			A nation, a people, <BR>
			A Brotherhood!&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 6<BR>
			<BR>
			1. There after was the structure set forth<BR>
			that all those of early age be given the Knighthood of Aaron, <BR>
			and responsibility corresponding to the office offices therein. <BR>
			2. Deacons, Teachers and Crusaders<BR>
			were all ordained and sent forth<BR>
			to preach the word of Galek to the people, <BR>
			supporting the Holy Order in actions, speech and thought<BR>
			and to wherever possible prevent iniquity, lying and backbiting. <BR>
			3. The Elders of the Knighthood known as Melchizedek<BR>
			were Ordained and Knighted by<BR>
			the sword and voice of Enochen himself, <BR>
			while we assisted through our own Holy Weapons. <BR>
			Elders, High Crusaders and the Apostles were all set apart<BR>
			and finally the Coronation of Enochen was held. <BR>
			4. The gathering was sparse indeed. <BR>
			There were only roughly 300 Knights left after the carnage, <BR>
			however, our spirits had been <BR>
			lifted by the Words of our Guardian. <BR>
			5. The 12 Apostles of the Order each with their sword<BR>
			upon the Shoulder of Enochen called out in accord, <BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;Enochen of Normane, <BR>
			by the authority of the Knighthood of Melchizedek, <BR>
			we the Apostles of the Holy Order <BR>
			do unanimously knight thee the <BR>
			Prophet, Seer and Revelator <BR>
			within our brotherhood. <BR>
			Along with the rights and privileges <BR>
			of the Guardian of the Holy Steps <BR>
			as well as Governor of all Brightmoon <BR>
			and all her peoples!&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 7<BR>
			<BR>
			1. And so it was in the 6th year<BR>
			of the Reign of the Prophets we were sustained by the hand<BR>
			of that all powerful deity who hath sent our Prophet. <BR>
			2. I saw in the remainder of my days<BR>
			a peace of sorts, perhaps a calm before the storm. <BR>
			3. Under the direction of our Prophet, <BR>
			strict codes of behavior were set <BR>
			forth encompassing language, <BR>
			chastity and all manner of ettiquette. <BR>
			4. &quot;For Behold, we shall be a clean people! <BR>
			An stalwart example of purity and cleanliness. <BR>
			5. We shall be a people true to our wives, <BR>
			respectful of them as equals <BR>
			and irreplaceably a part of all we stand for. <BR>
			6. Ye, shall be clean in speech and in grooming. <BR>
			7. Never let they self become obsessed <BR>
			by any manner of worldly desire. <BR>
			For this is not your World. <BR>
			Ye have been sent here to overcome <BR>
			all of these carnal inclinations. <BR>
			Yea, is this not what was taught by the<BR>
			mouth of Galek the Wise?&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 8<BR>
			<BR>
			1. Now I thank my creator, <BR>
			that I have had a life of relative peace<BR>
			under the leadership of such a fine example, <BR>
			our Prophet. <BR>
			<BR>
			2. May we always remember his gift to us<BR>
			3. Now I bid thee an everlasting farewell, <BR>
			save ye shall come unto the Knighthood<BR>
			and employ the Edicts of Faith and Tenants of Membership <BR>
			as revealed to us by the hand of Deity. 
			<H3>The Book of Ethren</H3>
			<P><BR>
			***************************************************** <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 1<BR>
			<BR>
			1. Oh that I had the voice of deity<BR>
			and could shout the words of our Prophets<BR>
			across the realm in one mighty breath! <BR>
			2. Yea, and with a voice of thunder declare truth unto all races. <BR>
			Even those ogres who have petitioned<BR>
			for the brotherly bond of civilization. <BR>
			3. Oh how glorious is the honor and morality of the Knighthood! <BR>
			4. Were all people as such could there be any wickedness? <BR>
			Nay, there could not. <BR>
			5. I have sought to go unto all nations, races and creeds<BR>
			that they mayest hear and embrace the noble words of the Prophet, <BR>
			and in wisdom, see that which is just and true. <BR>
			6. Oh that I could have my wish and stay a Crusader forever! <BR>
			Yea, and for all eternity declare this message of beauty. <BR>
			7. Yet I do not joy in my own success alone, <BR>
			but my joy is more full because of my brethren<BR>
			who have gone up unto the realm of the Drow, <BR>
			yea and those Dwarves as well. <BR>
			8. Behold have they not labored exceedingly? <BR>
			Yea, and behold they have brought forth much fruit, <BR>
			and how great shall be their reward! <BR>
			9. Now, I think of the success of these my brethren<BR>
			and my soul is carried away, for they have not only brought hundreds<BR>
			to the truth but have sown peace amongst eternal hatreds. <BR>
			10. Oh how great shall be there joy. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 2<BR>
			<BR>
			1. Yes now the time has come for me to accept a new calling, <BR>
			for our noble prophet Enochen doth wax extremely old. <BR>
			Yea he doth confound even our clerics with his longevity. <BR>
			Certainly he hath been prospered by the hand of that Great Creator. <BR>
			2. Yet even great ones must pass away, <BR>
			for verily this is the way of the World, that the old may be released<BR>
			and the young take their place in the realm of leadership. <BR>
			3. Now, despite my frailties I have accepted this calling, <BR>
			as well as those records diligently kept and preserved<BR>
			by the hand of Endralil the young. <BR>
			For alas, he is no longer so young, <BR>
			and he too, even our great Apostle must too pass away. <BR>
			4. May the prayers of the Knighthood suffer me<BR>
			that I may lead them in the way of Galek. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 3<BR>
			<BR>
			1. Truth is power and power is Victory. <BR>
			2. A true leader is a man that learns to use truth<BR>
			to inspire others as friends. <BR>
			3. For Henceforth I call ye not servants, <BR>
			for a servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; <BR>
			but I call you friends for all that I know I make known unto you. <BR>
			4. Brethren we must commit ourselves to the Truth<BR>
			and let nothing dilute that faith; <BR>
			for he that is diluted is a water from the Myrian sea to the taste. <BR>
			5. Let not thyself be diluted for as that sea water ye must be spewn out<BR>
			and trodden underfoot by those oppressors<BR>
			and their abominable leader The Vampire of Logrus. <BR>
			6. Knights you are, and sometimes we must sing alone. <BR>
			7. For even now they are at our gates, <BR>
			yea and all these cites round about<BR>
			waiting to destroy and pillage the hearts of men. <BR>
			8. Yea, I am seeing that even now our missionaries<BR>
			in Grimoire Haven lieth in their blood! <BR>
			9. Yea and they have been slain by that secret band<BR>
			which was established by Thracion of Logrus! <BR>
			Go now and see if it is not so! <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 4<BR>
			<BR>
			1. In a tumult of gasps and fear the Elite guardsmen<BR>
			ran straightway out of the city to see of this<BR>
			which had been prophesied by that great seer Ethren. <BR>
			2. &quot;We rode all day until we came to the place of Grimoire Haven, <BR>
			yea we sought out, even as Ethren <BR>
			hath spoken, the stronghold of the brethren <BR>
			therein and they did lie their blood, <BR>
			even as it had been testified by our Seer. <BR>
			3. We were astonished insomuch that we did fall to the earth; <BR>
			and behold after we has recovered from our astonishment, <BR>
			behold they did cast us into prison. <BR>
			4. Now as for the murder of these men <BR>
			we know not who has done it; <BR>
			and only this much do we know<BR>
			that we have rode and came as desired, <BR>
			according to the words of Ethren.&quot; <BR>

			Chapter 1<BR>
			<BR>
			1.Now this was the intent of the Cult for they had placed spies<BR>
			amongst the inhabitants even somuch<BR>
			that they infested the Judgement Seat itself. <BR>
			2.And now it came to pass that those debase fiends<BR>
			did plant in the minds of the citizens of Grimoire Haven<BR>
			that I, the Prophet and Guardian of the Order<BR>
			had excersised my wrath over mine own brethren, <BR>
			yea, and wove so many more lies amongst them<BR>
			that they may bring about contention<BR>
			and stir up the hearts of men against our brotherhood<BR>
			and also against myself. <BR>
			3.Yea and they did go on to say, <BR>
			&quot;How is it so that this Ethren the supposed seer<BR>
			hast known of this murder before we? <BR>
			4.Behold, we know that this Ethren must have agreed<BR>
			with his own guardsmen to put these our citizens to the sword, <BR>
			and he hath done so that he might declare it unto us, <BR>
			that he might convert us unto his faith, <BR>
			that he might raise himself up to be a great man, <BR>
			chosen of the deities, and a Prophet. <BR>
			5.And behold will we not detect this man? <BR>
			Yea, and he shall confess his fault and make known unto us<BR>
			the true murderer of these two men.&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 2<BR>
			<BR>
			1.Yea and they caused that I should be taken, <BR>
			and I suffered it to be so.and they did bind my wrists. <BR>
			2.Then they began to question me<BR>
			in divers way that they may cross me, <BR>
			that they might accuse me to death saying, <BR>
			3.&quot;Thou are a man of the Knighthood, <BR>
			who has done this murder? <BR>
			Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault;&quot; <BR>
			saying, <BR>
			4.&quot;Behold here is money; and also we will grant thee thy life<BR>
			if thou wilt tell us, and acknowledge the agreement<BR>
			which thou hast made with him.&quot; <BR>
			5.Verily I said unto them, <BR>
			&quot;O ye fools, ye weak of heart, ye blind<BR>
			and ye stiffnecked people, <BR>
			do you know how long the hand of Galek<BR>
			shall suffer you that ye should go on<BR>
			in this way of immorality and deceit? <BR>
			6.O ye ought to howl and mourn<BR>
			because of the great destruction that doth await you<BR>
			if ye do not repent! <BR>
			7.Behold ye say that I have agreed with a man<BR>
			that he should murder our own missionaries. <BR>
			But behold, I say unto you, <BR>
			that this is because I have testified unto you<BR>
			that ye might know concerning this thing; <BR>
			yea, even for a witness unto you, <BR>
			that I did know of the abominations among you. <BR>
			8.And because I have done this, <BR>
			ye say that I have agreed with a man that he should do this thing; <BR>
			yea, because I showed unto you this ye are angry with me<BR>
			and seek to take away my life. <BR>
			9.And now behold, I will show unto you another sign<BR>
			and see if ye will in this thing seek to destroy me. <BR>
			10. Behold go unto the house of Darak Z'Tharnin<BR>
			and say unto him, Has Ethren the pretended prophet<BR>
			who doth prophesy so much decadence amongst this people, <BR>
			agreed with thee in the which ye have murdered<BR>
			those missionaries who are of our own city? <BR>
			11. And behold he shall say unto you, Nay. <BR>
			12. And then ye shall say unto him, <BR>
			Have ye murdered those missionaries of Galek? <BR>
			13. And he shall stand with fear and wist not what to say. <BR>
			And behold, he shall deny unto you; <BR>
			and shall make as though he were astonished; <BR>
			nevertheless, he shall declare unto that he is innocent. <BR>
			14. but behold ye shall examine him, <BR>
			and ye shall find blood upon the skirts of his cloak. <BR>
			And when ye shall see this, ye shall say: <BR>
			15. From whence cometh this blood? <BR>
			Do we not know that this is the blood of those missionaries? <BR>
			16. Then shall he tremble and look pale, <BR>
			even as death had come upon him. <BR>
			17. And then ye shall say: <BR>
			Because of this fear which has come upon your face, <BR>
			behold we know that thou art guilty. <BR>
			18. And then shall greater fear come upon him; <BR>
			and then shall he confess unto you, <BR>
			and deny no more that he has done this murder. <BR>
			And then shall he say unto you, that I Ethren, <BR>
			know nothing concerning this matter<BR>
			save it were given me by the power of Diety. <BR>
			19. And then ye shall know that I am an honest man<BR>
			and am sent to you by the hand of Galek the Wise.&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 3<BR>
			<BR>
			1.And it came to pass that they went<BR>
			and did according as I had said. <BR>
			2.And behold the words which I had said they found to be true, <BR>
			according to the words which he denied, <BR>
			as well as those he confessed. <BR>
			3.Insomuch as my Guards and myself were set at liberty<BR>
			and Darak was taken captive. <BR>
			4.Now there were some who believed in my words as a Prophet, <BR>
			and others who thought I was a Deity, <BR>
			for in their minds except I was I could not know all this. <BR>
			5.And it came to pass that there arose<BR>
			a great division among the people<BR>
			that they divided hither and thither<BR>
			and went there way leaving us alone. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 4<BR>
			<BR>
			1.Now I was prompted I must strike down<BR>
			the cause of this murder at the very center. <BR>
			2.Without delay we rushed to make<BR>
			preparations for a counter strike<BR>
			for I was in mine anger. <BR>
			3.Yea and I did ponder much what I should do<BR>
			within the halls of our cathedral whilst around me clanged<BR>
			the preparations of war. <BR>
			4.When before me appeared a personage<BR>
			of Glory and brightness. <BR>
			5.&quot;Greetings Ethren, blessed art thou<BR>
			for those things which thou hast done. <BR>
			6.I have beheld how thou hast declared the word<BR>
			with unwearingness of heart and a purity of mind. <BR>
			7.Thou hast not feared thine oppressors, <BR>
			in spite of them seeking to take away your life, <BR>
			but hast sought only to do my will. <BR>
			8.Now because thou hast done<BR>
			this I will make thee mighty<BR>
			in word and in deed. <BR>
			9.Even that ye may smite upon that <BR>
			foul one that ruineth The World<BR>
			with his treachery.&quot; <BR>
			10. And with that he stretched forth<BR>
			his finger and touched my blade. <BR>
			And it did course with power. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 5<BR>
			<BR>
			1.The battle raged tremendous. <BR>
			2.Our allegiances the bullywugs, and forest rangers evaporated<BR>
			amidst the treachery and vast bribes<BR>
			funded from slavery and oppression<BR>
			at the hands of Logrus's Vampyr and his minions. <BR>
			3.Hoards of orcs flanked our boundaries, <BR>
			but were of little consequence before the Elite Paladin Guard. <BR>
			4.However, our routes of retreat collapsed as their numerous hosts<BR>
			descended with carnal fury upon my valient army of Knights. <BR>
			5.Many had fallen, yet we had reached the gates of Logrus<BR>
			with a ferocity and vindication for our fallen brothers. <BR>
			6.It seemed as though we had finally gained a hold<BR>
			upon the walls of the mighty fortress walls surrounding logrus, <BR>
			when a cries of pain penetrated the my ranks<BR>
			as a suffocating darkness engulfed our bodies. <BR>
			7.No doubt this was the work of their perverese Deities. <BR>
			My men crippled in pain. <BR>
			8.I felt mine own frame sustained only through the faith within. <BR>
			9.With a loud voice I cried unto them, <BR>
			&quot;Ye shall not be slain by your enemies! <BR>
			10. For it has been spoken, <BR>
			&quot;Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed!&quot; <BR>
			We must prevent the subjugation of our lands, <BR>
			our people, our liberty and our Faith! <BR>
			Victory for them and for Galek!&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 6<BR>
			<BR>
			1.We did fight as with the strength of dragons! <BR>
			Yea and we did press forward through the darkness<BR>
			into the very heart of the city. <BR>
			2.There my greatest horror awaited. <BR>
			His fiendish grin inspired a fear that was inhuman. <BR>
			I was frozen and heard amidst the cries of my dying brethren<BR>
			only my heart pound. <BR>
			3.&quot;Chortling, he bent towards my leader. <BR>
			I saw only his armored frame, motionless. <BR>
			I wanted to cry out for help, but I could not, <BR>
			I was held powerless by the power of the dark creature. <BR>
			4. His hand came up to that of Ethren, <BR>
			touching his cheek softly.with a cruel tenderness. <BR>
			5. Tears rolled down my eyes as the great frame of Ethren <BR>
			shriveled beneath the touch of this, this, Prince of Death. <BR>
			6. Almost unconscious and without hope <BR>
			my eyes witnessed something incredible. <BR>
			The Sword of Galek still coursed with an incredible power. <BR>
			7. Drawing deep within his final reserves of faith and hope, <BR>
			M'lord lifted the pulsating Devastator enough to palpate the deamon. <BR>
			Reeling in pain the Vampyre cried out mightily <BR>
			shredding the sounds of war with his wail. <BR>
			8. White magik purified the vulgar body as a poison. <BR>
			Its hands clenched in agony. <BR>
			9. Shrieking he dropped the withered body of Ethren to the ground, <BR>
			through himself upon his steed <BR>
			which charged at his will eastward to the abyss <BR>
			we know now as the Temple of the Undead.&quot;

			Chapter 1<BR>
			<BR>
			1. I am the son of Chemish, who was the son of Golgondren, <BR>
			who was the son of Almaran, who lived in the Day of Ethren the Seer. <BR>
			2. It came to pass in the year of the Prophets 250, <BR>
			I Ammondron, having been charged by the clergy to reassemble<BR>
			this record of the Holy Order and deliver it up unto them<BR>
			to be placed amidst the archives of<BR>
			the Cathedral, didst set to the task <BR>
			of abridging the records of our Fathers. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 2<BR>
			<BR>
			1. These last months our attendances had been very low. <BR>
			2. Ever since the knowledge of Galeks Faerie background<BR>
			and brotherhood with Logrus was discovered from within the texts<BR>
			of the High Ones, we have been struggling for a purpose. <BR>
			3. Pawns in a game.Alas.Pawns in a game, so they say. <BR>
			I don't see how this changes things. Are we not still a Brotherhood? <BR>
			Do we not still have the Truth? <BR>
			4. Alas with no Prophet, no guidance, <BR>
			tis my fear there is no need for our Knights. <BR>
			5. The fall of Ethren rocked the foundation <BR>
			of our retreating Knighthood, <BR>
			for where was his successor? <BR>
			6. Nor could the quorum receive inspiration<BR>
			as to who would be chosen next. <BR>
			They sat for months in the Cathedral praying and imploring<BR>
			the Great Creator to reveal the next Prophet, <BR>
			however, the heavens remained silent. <BR>
			7. It was decided that the Quorum would <BR>
			disband and go in search of a sign. <BR>
			Each left their occupations, homes and families<BR>
			forsaking all but their mission and departing<BR>
			into The World in search of an answer. <BR>
			8. Not a one returned. <BR>
			9. The Knighthood was in a crisis. <BR>
			Without Apostles or a Prophet <BR>
			were compelled to separate the Orders<BR>
			religious clergy from the professional government. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 3<BR>
			<BR>
			1. The Constitution was drawn up amidst a council of remaining Elders. <BR>
			The first draft was done in three months. <BR>
			2. Detailing the checks of the Melchizedek Knighthood<BR>
			over that of the Aaronic, which now represented the layman masses, <BR>
			and vice versa. <BR>
			3. It affirmed the Tenants of Faith and Edicts of Membership, <BR>
			yet substituted a clause for lack of Prophetic guidance. <BR>
			4. The responsibility in that case was given to a Proctor<BR>
			who was to appoint assistants to help in his administration. <BR>
			5. The Quorum of the 12, then made up the governing council<BR>
			of chief-judges for the land, <BR>
			governed the people under the direction of the Proctor<BR>
			and his administration for many years. <BR>
			6. While the 2 spheres of Knighthood sought to represent<BR>
			the desires of the people economically as well as militarily. <BR>
			7. And therein the brotherhood was governed by the Law<BR>
			administered unto them by their fathers which was just and true, <BR>
			and delivered by the hand of the Deities themselves. <BR>
			8. Bishops and Priests were also set apart and consecrated<BR>
			by the Elders to care for the religious needs of the people, <BR>
			as well as plead to the Deities to free us from this dark period. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 4<BR>
			<BR>
			1. The stress between the Holy Order of Knights and the Cultists<BR>
			lessened due to the Leadership crisis of the day, <BR>
			additionally abated by that new knowledge that has shaken<BR>
			the foundations of both religions. <BR>
			2. There were occasional flares of fervor, however, <BR>
			our first Proctor Lord Michan was a keen man<BR>
			and did quell many rebellions and uprisings<BR>
			with his stratagem and bureaucracy. <BR>
			3. Yea, and Michan did set forth spies round about, <BR>
			that he might know when the Cultist were<BR>
			to come upon them and from where. <BR>
			4. Therein he came to know the intentions of the Logrites, <BR>
			that it was their intention to destroy their brethren, <BR>
			or subject them and bring them to bondage<BR>
			that they might establish a kingdom unto themselves over all the land. <BR>
			5. And he also knowing that it was the only desire<BR>
			of the Knighthood of the Holy Order to preserve their lands, <BR>
			and their liberty, and their faith. <BR>
			6. Therefore he thought it no sin that he should defend them even by<BR>
			stratagem, hence, he found by his spies<BR>
			which actions the cultists would take. <BR>
			7. Yea and he did armor, equip and train his people mightily, <BR>
			and caused that they might become and industrious people<BR>
			full of hard work and honest labor. <BR>
			Yea and Brightmoon began to flourish once again. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 5<BR>
			<BR>
			1. Our missionaries became ambassadors and beacons to many races; <BR>
			Ever willing to spread the message of Galek the Wise<BR>
			and wherever they went the protection<BR>
			of the Guardian of the Steps followed. <BR>
			2. And there was peace in the land for many years. <BR>
			
			<H3>The First Book of Vangard</H3>
			<P><BR>
			***************************************************** <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 1<BR>
			<BR>
			1. I Vangard having been born of goodly parents, <BR>
			and taught in the language of my father, <BR>
			do herein make a record of my days. <BR>
			2. I was born in the year of the Prophets 620<BR>
			in the lands known as the<BR>
			Frontier. My Father was a just and true<BR>
			teacher who taught me much<BR>
			in the way of the Knighthood and in my ancestry. <BR>
			3. Jedin my older brother used to tell me of his adventures<BR>
			in the Knighthood while we played amidst<BR>
			the forests of Mount Kolvir, <BR>
			and hunted beasts for food. <BR>
			4. I had never ventured to the pinnacle<BR>
			of the mountain, nor had Jedin, <BR>
			yet in the year 635 when I was just old <BR>
			enough to hold my Fathers<BR>
			Holy Defender, I embarked upon the<BR>
			journey that would change my life. <BR>
			5. Jedin had been called off on a crusade against ice trolls<BR>
			to the north, and having been left behind I went to the mountain<BR>
			to pray for his safety. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 2<BR>
			<BR>
			1. As I knelt I felt compelled upward. <BR>
			Without further thought I obeyed. <BR>
			I climbed until the air began to thin and yet I was lifted yet again<BR>
			to my feet and carried heavenward towards the mountain peak. <BR>
			2. The way was rugged and steep, without path or foothold. <BR>
			I looked about myself and grew scared as a mist of darkness<BR>
			descended down upon me. A cloud I thought. <BR>
			3. The penetrating wetness made movement even more deadly, <BR>
			yet I was determined now to reach<BR>
			the highest point of Mount Kolvir. <BR>
			4. Just as I saw light upon the icy <BR>
			peak shattering the mist around me, <BR>
			I was overcome with an exhaustion that did cause me to quake<BR>
			and tremble exceedingly for fear I should fall from my ledge. <BR>
			5. I felt as though my short life had come to a close<BR>
			when upon my shoulder I felt a hand pulling me upward<BR>
			which set me safely upon the Mountain preface. <BR>
			6. Before me shown a Man whose brightness exceeded<BR>
			that of the sunlight reflecting upon the ice before me. <BR>
			7. &quot;Vangard son of Lancen, <BR>
			I am Elyon Creator and most High Deity, <BR>
			behold Jevon, listen, <BR>
			for he hath a purpose for you.&quot; <BR>
			8. Looking to the right, I beheld another Man<BR>
			clothed as a beggar that was hereto hidden from my sight<BR>
			amidst the Glory of the former. <BR>
			9. His eyes were of kindness and mercy. <BR>
			As he spoke with a softness of a breeze<BR>
			I felt a love for me in his voice. <BR>
			10. &quot;Fear not brother, for you have done well before me. <BR>
			11. Go ye unto the Cathedral in Brightmoon, <BR>
			and collect the records of your fathers contained there in. <BR>
			12. You are to explain that we have been with them <BR>
			from the beginning. <BR>
			13. Yea, we have watched our children give ye truth<BR>
			through a chosen Prophet, our son Galek. <BR>
			14. Now ye shall be called to restore thy fallen Order <BR>
			to its true beauty and fullness of purpose. <BR>
			15. Go now, and learn of thy past; <BR>
			grow in stature and in knowledge; <BR>
			we shall return and visit you in a time.&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 3<BR>
			<BR>
			1. I was left to myself to collapse. <BR>
			I slept. <BR>
			3. However, what I had seen was as clear and as poignant<BR>
			to my mind as the moment it occurred. <BR>
			4. As I stood, I heard the hoofing of a winged horse<BR>
			whose snorting blew mist into the cold mountain air. <BR>
			5. I approached it instinctively. <BR>
			Sliding my hand along the main of the mythical beast, <BR>
			6. I gently mounted his unsaddled back. <BR>
			He stood firm. <BR>
			7. Then soaring into the sky I was returned to my home. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 4<BR>
			<BR>
			1. As soon as I packed my belongings, <BR>
			my brother and I departed for<BR>
			Grimhaven. <BR>
			2. There I met my best friend Azor. <BR>
			We took employment as street cleaners, <BR>
			ridding the town of rats and the like. <BR>
			3. I knew I had a purpose elsewhere, <BR>
			and before long I departed alone to traverse the treacherous<BR>
			Parnitian Mountain range filled with<BR>
			terrific Tytans in hopes of reaching the<BR>
			fabled Brightmoon home of Galek the Wise. <BR>
			4. After much tribulation, I arrived at the gates of the city<BR>
			only to be told by the Bishop's priests I would not be able<BR>
			to gain an audience with the Bishop until<BR>
			I had first proven myself worthy of the Knighthood. <BR>
			5. They sent me to quell the wicked Drow uprisings<BR>
			in an effort to strength relations with the Druids in that Area. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 5<BR>
			<BR>
			1. I did as I was instructed spending several years<BR>
			vanquishing Dark Elves from the land. <BR>
			2. I returned 3 years later to be dubbed<BR>
			a Crusader by the hand of Huma<BR>
			into the Knighthood of Aaron. <BR>
			3. Finally, I was permitted to study the <BR>
			ancient texts of the Prophets. <BR>
			4. The vision of Elyon and Jevon never faded from my mind<BR>
			I saw their hand in all our successes and<BR>
			wisdom within their Prophet, <BR>
			Galek the Wise. <BR>
			5. The breadth of my mission did not <BR>
			occur to me until much later. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 6<BR>
			<BR>
			1. In time the growth of the Cult was <BR>
			manifested by the emergence<BR>
			of the Templars. Anxieties in the land grew numerous. <BR>
			2. Crusaders were sent to Grimhaven to <BR>
			stand against Drow and Kobold<BR>
			invasions. <BR>
			3. There the merchants had grown strong <BR>
			and assembled themselves in one body<BR>
			representative of their goals and desires. <BR>
			4. The Arena was erected to settle the<BR>
			many quarrels that emerged<BR>
			within the teeming society, helping to calm the populous. <BR>
			5. Nevertheless, there were many among <BR>
			them who began to be proud, <BR>
			contending warmly with their adversaries, even unto blows; <BR>
			yea, they would smite one another with their fists. <BR>
			6. The distinctions between factions soon grew into contentions, <BR>
			false doctrines were taught as truth. <BR>
			Yea, and they did persecute one another<BR>
			and afflict each other with words. <BR>
			7. Hearts were hardened, <BR>
			and many names were blotted out from<BR>
			amongst even the Knighthood. <BR>
			Now this was a great trial to those <BR>
			that did stand fast in the faith; <BR>
			nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable<BR>
			in keeping the commandments of Elyon <BR>
			delivered by the hand of Galek himself, <BR>
			and they bore with patience the persecutions<BR>
			which were heaped upon them. <BR>
			8. And they did impart of their substance, <BR>
			every Knight according to that which he had, to the poor, <BR>
			and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted<BR>
			for there were indeed many caused by <BR>
			the greed of the Snake Merchants. <BR>
			9. Yea, and they did not wear costly apparel, <BR>
			yet they were neat and comely. <BR>
			And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, <BR>
			they did not send away any who were naked, <BR>
			or that were hungry, or that were athirst. <BR>
			10. Their hearts were not set upon riches, <BR>
			therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, <BR>
			both bond and free, both male and female, <BR>
			whether without the Knighthood or within, <BR>
			having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 7<BR>
			<BR>
			1. In the commencement of the 674th year of the Prophets<BR>
			there began to be a contention among the people; <BR>
			for a certain man being called Bertand Farreach of Amber, <BR>
			he being a very cunning man, yea, and a wise man<BR>
			as to the wisdom of the World, he being after the Order of the Red. <BR>
			2. Now this Bertand had drawn away much of the People after him; <BR>
			even so much that they began to be very powerful; <BR>
			and began to endeavor to establish Bertand as king over the people. <BR>
			3. Now this was alarming to the people of the land for they knew<BR>
			that according to their law such things were to be established<BR>
			by their voices alone. <BR>
			4. Therefore, if it were possible that Bertand should<BR>
			gain the voice of the people and possession of the throne, <BR>
			he being a man of the World, <BR>
			would deprive them of their rights and privileges of worship; <BR>
			for it was his intent to destroy the Knighthood. <BR>
			5. And thus did the people assemble themselves together, <BR>
			every man according to his mind, <BR>
			whether it be for or against Bertand. <BR>
			6. And it came to pass that the voice <BR>
			of the people came against Bertand, <BR>
			that he was not made king over the people. <BR>
			7. Now this did cause much joy amongst<BR>
			the brethren of the Knighthood, <BR>
			yet Bertand did stir up anger against those <BR>
			who were not in his favor. <BR>
			8. And it came to pass that his followers <BR>
			did assemble themselves together<BR>
			and did consecrate Bertand to be their King. <BR>
			9. And he did command them to<BR>
			take up arms against their brethren; <BR>
			and this he did that he might subject them to him. <BR>
			10. Now never before had the people <BR>
			of Grimhaven seen so much carnage. <BR>
			11. Nevertheless, Elyon did strengthen <BR>
			the hands of the freemen of Grimhaven<BR>
			that they slew those of Order of Bertand with great slaughter, <BR>
			that they began to flee before them. <BR>
			12. And it came to pass that those Freemen<BR>
			did pursue the Red Order all that day, <BR>
			and did slay them with much slaughter, <BR>
			in so much that there were slain of the Order of Bertand<BR>
			twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls; <BR>
			and there were slain of the Freemen six<BR>
			thousand five hundred and two souls. <BR>
			13. And when the King of Grimhaven <BR>
			could pursue Bertand no longer the Proctor<BR>
			of Brightmoon Augustine the Great sent forth spies to follow<BR>
			the remnant of the Red Order Elite forces, <BR>
			that he might know of their plans and their plots, <BR>
			whereby he might assist the King of<BR>
			Grimhaven in guarding against them, <BR>
			that he might preserve the people from being destroyed. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 8<BR>
			<BR>
			1. Yea, and those spies struck with<BR>
			great fear did return with haste saying, <BR>
			&quot;Behold, we followed the camp of the Red Order, <BR>
			and to our great astonishment, <BR>
			in the land of the Great Waste above the land of the Dark elves <BR>
			we saw a numerous host of Logrites; <BR>
			and behold Bertand and the Red Order have joined them! <BR>
			And they are upon our brethren in that Land even those Druids, <BR>
			and they are fleeing from before them with their flocks, <BR>
			and their wives, and their children towards our city; <BR>
			and except we make haste they will attain possession of our city <BR>
			and also of our families!&quot; <BR>
			2. Further reports by our spies indicated that The Templars, <BR>
			lead by Deus and Ebon, had declared war against Brightmoon. <BR>
			3. I was called to strike back at the heart of Logrus, <BR>
			The Grandmaster himself, while the primary front led by the Guardian<BR>
			would make their stand the flats on the banks of the river Kranor. <BR>

			<BR>
			Chapter 1<BR>
			<BR>
			1. The Logrus Master had grown strong during these decades<BR>
			of persecution and tyranny, <BR>
			in addition to additional support from <BR>
			Bertand and his Order of Snakes, <BR>
			and their Wicked Ones on high. <BR>
			2. I prayed to Elyon that he might instruct me as to my purpose, <BR>
			but my mind was left with a stupor of thought. <BR>
			3. Jedin joined me in my first assault<BR>
			on the keep along with my father. <BR>
			However, our full on charge was<BR>
			crushed quickly by the Orcish Guardsmen<BR>
			and allies of the Cult and their Leader Aeschalus III. <BR>
			4. I saw my brother fall amoung the filth of their city, helpless. <BR>
			5. Enraged, I urged my horse forward at lightning speed. <BR>
			6. Our spies had cleared the way to the Center of town. <BR>
			Sir Nuke of the Sunshadow was waiting <BR>
			to lead me to the vile Temple Pyramid. <BR>
			7. Armed with all my mind could think of, <BR>
			yet alone with only a handful of Paladins, <BR>
			we charged forth to that Rectory of Death. <BR>
			8. My preparations were not enough nor was my power. <BR>
			My friends were held from assisting<BR>
			save their holy calls for my well being. <BR>
			Their prayers alone enabled me to survive as long as I did. <BR>
			9. &quot;O Elyon, have mercy and spare my life, <BR>
			that I may be an instrument in thy hands <BR>
			to save and preserve this people!&quot; <BR>
			10. My body fell limp, and there was darkness. <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 2<BR>
			<BR>
			1. &quot;My son, why hast thou come here?&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			2. &quot;I know not m'lord.&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			3. &quot;Look,&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			4. And I looked and beheld The<BR>
			World upon which I was created. <BR>
			I beheld also the inhabitants there on, <BR>
			even all the inhabitants of The World. <BR>
			5. Yea, and their numbers were great <BR>
			even as the sands of the seas. <BR>
			<BR>
			6. &quot;Please tell me why were<BR>
			these created and how?&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			7. &quot;By my Spirit Children, <BR>
			the fairies have I hereto for formed them, <BR>
			and for a wise purpose that remaineth in me&quot; <BR>
			8. &quot;For I am Elyon, and I alone shalt thou worship. <BR>
			Yea except thou callest upon me in prayer <BR>
			thou shalt not receive strength. <BR>
			9. For there are other deities that will seek <BR>
			<BR>
			to destroy and tempt you Vangard. <BR>
			<BR>
			10. Even they will seek to rend thy <BR>
			body even as this one has done. <BR>
			11. Yea and I said I would come to thee again and so it is. <BR>
			12. You will reform the Holy Orde<BR>
			r which teacheth men to do good; <BR>
			13. Learn obedience, sacrifice and faith for thus only <BR>
			will they be worthy servants. <BR>
			14. Learn the wisdom of the Prophets, <BR>
			especially that of my servant Galek. <BR>
			15. Unite the Knighthood that they <BR>
			may shine forth unto The World <BR>
			and prepare the people thereon.&quot; <BR>
			16. &quot;Now, return to them and do as I have spoken. <BR>
			17. For this is my work and my glory. Even so.&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Chapter 3<BR>
			<BR>
			1. And it came to pass that when I awoke I had forgotten all else<BR>
			save that commandment from Elyon to reform, in its purity, <BR>
			the Knighthood of the Holy Order<BR>
			under the laws and guidance given by the Prophets of old. <BR>
