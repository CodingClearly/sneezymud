<P>In general SneezyMUD 5.0 differs from
SneezyMUD 4.1 in that there is an increased reliance on both race and skill learning in
deciding what you can do and skill learning will be not just dependent on intelligence and level but how long or often you have used a skill.</P>
<p>
Stats are important but they are not an independent
category.  They are majorly influenced by your choice of race, and partially by home terrain and player choice.  There are planned racial skills
and attributes that will further affect your character and which will help us to adjust balances if needed. If you want a certain set of stats, choose a <b>race</b> carefully.</P>
