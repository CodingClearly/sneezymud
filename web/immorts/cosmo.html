	<DD>Cosmo likes hanging out in Coffee Houses and Chinese Restaurants in San Francisco. Well maybe Cosmo doesnt
	but some guy named Ben Sarnoff who seems to pull his strings does. Sometimes its hard to tell the difference between
	the two but there are some ways to tell. Ben is made of flesh and blood, Cosmo some electronic patterns. Ben was
	born in New York City some time ago, Cosmo in the town of Grimhaven about 2 years ago in some universe called 3.0.
	Possibly the easiest way to tell is that to get where they are, Cosmo went to school for years while Ben just had
	to kill a few thousand people. Hmmm.
