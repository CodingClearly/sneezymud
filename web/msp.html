MUD Sound Protocol - MSP
</strong></bold></font>
<p>
SneezyMUD is now supporting MSP, the MUD Sound Protocol, for delivery of all sounds.  MSP is a standard that many MUD servers and MUD clients have adopted as a means to introduce sound into the otherwise silent world of mudding.
<p>
In order to take advantage of MSP via SneezyMUD, you must enable MSP while connected to SneezyMUD by typing "terminal msp".  Additionally, you must be using a MSP compliant client for connecting to SneezyMUD.
<p>
<a href="./client">The SneezyMUD client</a> is the MSP-compliant client of choice.  For more information about MSP, or for a list of MSP-compliant MUD clients, please <a href="http://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/msp.htm">click here.</a>
<p>
We have noted some problems with MSP not downloading sounds appropriately.  If you are having problems with MSP related to the FTP download of the sounds, insure that your client is able to download sounds.  If you continue to have problems, all sounds SneezyMUD uses can be found <a href="./sounds">here</a> and you may download them manually into your MSP client directory.
