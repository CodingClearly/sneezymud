(spellbags)
<P>
Spellbags are special magical containers for components.  Since they cannot
be used to hold regular (non-components) items, they are often thought of as
being of little use.  However, they have two useful qualities.
<P>
First, they protect components from decay.  Some components go bad over time,
but the interior of a spellbag is magically shielded from the ravages of time.
<P>
Secondly, they are magically attuned to the forces of thaumaturgy.  Thus, if
a spell calls for you to hold a component in your secondary hand, you could
either keep all the components separate, attempt to remember which one you need
for a given spell and grab it at the proper time (in the thick of battle?), 
or... throw all your components in a spellbag, and when you are ready to cast
a given spell, merely grab the spellbag.  The spell will find the component
it needs within the spellbag and utilize it properly.
