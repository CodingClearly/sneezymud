<P>
Chances are, the character you currently have will have to be redone.  I
say this because most new players realize sooner or later the choices they
made at the outset are not optimal for some reason or other.
<P>
The first order of business is learning what stats to set.  Read through
the help files on the classes (HELP <A HREF="../help/class">CLASS</A>) and races (HELP <A HREF="../help/race">RACE</A>).  Then
talk to people about what they chose and what problems they have.
<P>
If in doubt, a human warrior is a very easy class to fiddle around with
to get your feet wet.  The non-human races have a lot of complex rules
that go along with them (but some nice benefits too), while the other
classes have a multitude of skills which often confuse the beginner.
