Dash : Ok
Sensei : frobby
Dash : current topics i have listed
Dash : rent, pracs/hps, multiclasses vs hybrid classes, eq damage
Dash : does anyone else want to add any topics to the list before we start?
Birch : fast mob healing, mob fleeing?
Elohssa : ah what is the list?
Sensei : mob healing rate?
Dunlen : Ooo slight advantage
Dunlen : um
Maarken : heard rumors of coded exp caps, if that's true, i would like to add that to the list.
Dash : List: rent, pracs/hps, multiclasses vs hybrid classes, eq damage
Dunlen : exp caps
Straxx : yea..i have 2 issues
Sensei : add mob healing rate to the list please
Elohssa : xpcap
Dunlen : crappy monk hps
Straxx : add mobs flee to damn fast
Frobozz : heh add trophy to that list
Straxx : and make holy water more attainable at lower levels
Dash : added: fleeing, exp caps, healing rates
Elohssa : id like yo add xpcap to list, please
Dash : and trophy
Araxus : faction percents actually do anything?
Sensei : trophy
Sensei : trophy
Sensei : trophy
Dash : sensei
Dash : NO SPAM
Sensei : sorry
Dash : or i kick you out
Sensei : k
Dash : that goes for everyone
Straxx : get my holy water issue?
Garush : level based eq!
Elohssa : 
Sensei : emotting is disabled?
Dash : yeah
Disposession : why do you want level based eq?
Sensei : anything like emoting?
Dash : ok
Sensei : sorry had to =)
Garush : cuz its cool
Elohssa : ok, p er but please define spam, or what constitutes it, so we clearly understand
Dash : to start off, first topic is rent
Dash : don't be annoying
Disposession : rent is good
Dash : don't repeat the same thing over and over and over
Sensei : ehhhhh
Dash : like sensei here
Sensei : you might be surprised about what rent will become if not changed from its current course
Dash : ok rent system - what are the opinions on the current setup
Sensei : if its course is what I believe it is
Frobozz : about rent, Is the 1 day rent tops cap still in play ?
Vryce : For the record is rent on limited items the same as in 5.1, the amounts I mean.
Birch : pls. outline what was wrong with the old setup?
Elohssa : i like the new setup
Dash : i think it is frobozz although we might have intended to remove it
Straxx : yea..some of us have yet to see what rent is..2:)
Straxx : explain
Disposession : new setup is good
Dash : vryce, at the moment costs are the same
Dunlen : ok
Dunlen : i think
Sensei : disp, you haven't had much good gear to rent, have you ;}
Dunlen : don't shoot me
Disposession : nope..not with this char
Sensei : you think?!?
Dunlen : but rent should be calculated on what items you're not wearing
Sensei : since when :P
Dash : hold
Dash : describing current and past setups for clarity
Dash : old system (5.0-5.1)
Dash : basically, classes had varying rent credits based on how much value of eq they SHOULD have
Dash : and then each peice of eq was valued automatically according to its attributes
Dash : basically, the way it worked was that people who could hang out and play alot
Dash : were the only ones who could afford to keep expensive eq
Dash : which was both bad and good
Dash : we changed it to the current setup
Dash : which basically only charges rent on limited items
Peel : I felt that it inhibited casual players too much
Dash : the costs on those items are determined the same way they were before
Dash : grr
Dash : garush, you're up
Garush : is there still rent credit?
Garush : no kidding
Garush : organizer , done
Dash : there is no rent credit currently
Dunlen : k
Dunlen : I think rent should be based on EQ that you're not using
Dash : btw, say Organizer, add me
Dash : to be added to the speaker list
Dunlen : that way, can't haord
Dunlen : er hoard
Dunlen : let's say you're a warrior
Dunlen : and want to have your kickass set of diamond eq
Dunlen : that shouldn't be penalized by having rent on every piece
Peel : I think we're more interested in the pros and cons of the current system, rather than proposing other systems
Dunlen : i thought this was also to propose solutions
Peel : yeah I suppose
Dash : we need to define a problem before you can go off on solutions
Dunlen : well
Dunlen : the problem
Dunlen : is that at high levels, a human warrior, in that other mud i used to play before,
Dunlen : they could wear full diamond
Dunlen : and be around max rent
Dunlen : and have a weap
Dunlen : etc
Dash : incorrect
Dunlen : now with this new code
Dunlen : wait
Dunlen : lemme finish
Peel : well he's right dash, to an extent
Peel : they just pay more for that now
Dunlen : now instead of being let's say 20k over
Peel : but with the rent adjusted, overall income will also be higher
Dunlen : or 30k a day
Dunlen : they are over 150k or 200k a day
Dunlen : because each piece is expensive
Dunlen : now
Dunlen : what i think
Dunlen : is that as long as you're wearing the eq
Dunlen : and using it, etc
Dunlen : you shouldn't be charged, or something.. that way if you have extra weapons
Dunlen : you get charged a hoarding fee
Dunlen : for the shit you're not using
Dunlen : which was one of the main problems in 5.1
Dunlen : people hoarding shit
Dunlen : sorry i haven't been drinking, i'm rational
Dunlen : so
Dunlen : i think that either rent should be based on shit you're not using
Dunlen : e.g.
Dunlen : i don't need this
Dunlen : yet it's free
Dunlen : i should get charged for holding it
Dunlen : ok
Straxx : I've played sneezy for a few years
Straxx : and I didn't much like the old system much
Straxx : i have yet to obtain stuff for rent yet..but Dunlen has a valid point
Straxx : i'm a casual mudder..and rent cost hurt my ability to enjoy a m ud
Straxx : having no rent on items you wear and use.sound logical
Peel : that was my point
Peel : not dunlens
Straxx : this would detour hoarding
Straxx : organize, done
Dash : the syntax is Organize, done
Dash : er Organizer, done
Straxx : Oranize, done
Dash : sorry
Straxx : Oranizer, done
Frobozz : is there ever going to be any notification on eq that it does cost rent ?
Frobozz : also when items showed there rent it was an easy way to value its worth, is there going to be an easy way to tell an items rough worth other than with evaluation?
Dash : i actually didn't like the 'easy way to evaluate their worth'
Dash : i thought that was kind of a cop out that made evaluate next to worthless
Peel : we haven't really discussed that issue much
Elohssa : ok, guess im up. i basically like the new system
Peel : this new rent system is kind of a stepping stone
Peel : to see what we can do with it
Dash : it also makes stuff like divinate and identify more valuable
Elohssa : rent has always been a pain, and high rent cost wont stop people from having items inappropriate from there lev
Dash : go ahead elohssa, sorry to take up your time :)
Elohssa : no problem
Jesus : subject?
Dash : rent
Elohssa : basically im glad to see the current system in and rent gone
Crane : The idea on rent detriment for hoarding is good, however, you need to balance for accessory items, priest weapons and symbols, etc, maybe a certain number should be allowd
Peel : I don't think we're ready to be redoing rent again, yet
Crane : One pet peeve of mine is low bank for monks as well 500 is too small imho
Crane : maybe a little higher, hard to get a corpse back sometimes with only 500 talens
Sensei : I was thinking that rent should start out at L25 or L30ish, and have a lower value than it did before, but still be in place for higher levels
Sensei : while I like the idea of lower value items being rentless (it's GREAT for mages... ;}), I think that the higher items can still be controlled by rent
Dash : explain reasoning?
Sensei : hear me out
Sensei : the better items as they now stand will cost you MUCHO rent
Sensei : if you put back in SOME rent credit, you will be able to have characters that have a few good items
Sensei : without hoarding
Sensei : basically I believe L50 players should have L50 items, one or two anyway
Sensei : and I think that would be a decent way to implement that
Sensei : a lower scale
Birch : I want to underscore Straxx's point about casual players
Birch : if all high player equip ends up costing insane rents
Birch : casual players will have to spend all their playing time scraping up cash
Birch : which is not what I enjoy about mudding
Birch : no more exploration or even just plain playing killing frenzies
Dash : rotfl
Vryce : will evaluate and compare allow some type of judgment between items?
Dash : they already do
Vryce : because if so, then I can set up a tirgger on my client to max out evaluate in no time
Vryce : thus giving client users a big advantage
Dash : c'est la vie, the only way around that
Dash : would be to make it purely level based
Dash : which is an option i guess
Birch : I like learn by doing
Sensei : I don't think that would be worthwhile
Dash : y'all can talk now :)
Frobozz : eval is a horrid skill to increase
Ciani : my concern with rent if for rangers.  I found I could have a bow and a couple arrows OR dual wield, not both
Crane : as is quivering palm :)
Sensei : if eval is to be our only method, it needs to be easier to learn
Frobozz : having that skill level based like wizardry etc would be a good idea in my opinion
Dash : that would be accounted for
Vryce : I was wondering about setting triggers to conatantly eval an item crashign the mud
Vryce : it seems to do that if I run the triggers
Disposession : maybe you should have some rent credit
Straxx : i think onto next issue..this one has 30 minutes old alreayd..2:)
Dash : i don't think thats whats been hanging us
Disposession : oh well, gotta goto an exam..bye all
Vryce : ok, good to know
Dash : but yeah lets hold to rent
Sensei : luck to ya
Dash : actually lets just move to next topic
Crane : what next?
Birch : may I ask a quick question?
Dash : does anybody have any interest in the current practices setup
Dash : sure, birch
Ciani : Organizer, show list
Sensei : I have a question about practices
Birch : will a summary of discussion 
Birch : and your responses be posted?
Dash : this meeting is being logged, i'll prolly post it on the net
Straxx : waht is wrong with current pract setup?
Dash : and summarize it when i have time
Dash : straxx, in my opinion nothing :)
Garush : 198 int gets 7 practices
Garush : 121 gets 7 practices
Dash : incorrect
Straxx : i like getting my 8/9 pracs..@:)
Sensei : 121 gets 6
Garush : I got 7 last time
Apollyon : 99 gets me 6/7
Dash : +int eq however does not count for your int total
Straxx : though..my int is 196..and i get random 8/9..
Sensei : dash, are pracs class-based?
Garush : my int is 190 plus
Frobozz : the pracs do seem to be more random
Dash : ok
Dash : explaing prac set up
Dash : basically it works like this - our mud is roughly balanced such that basic training extends from 1-30th level
Dash : and advanced training is from 31-50
Dash : depending on your int, you finish basic training either earlier or later than that average value
Dash : your prac per level are calculated for that curve
Dash : 198 int does NOT get the same as 120 int
Dash : also, all classes get the same pracs for 1-30 (or until basic training is over)
Dash : it is after that that it varies by class
Sensei : actually, I don't believe that
Sensei : and here's why
Sensei : I get 6-7 practices
Dash : dont believe what?
Sensei : usually 6
Sensei : my new deikhan has 50 more int than me (roughly) and gets usually 6, sometimes 7
Sensei : I have 70ish int
Sensei : ummmmmmm
Sensei : that's why I asked about classes
Sensei : cuz it doesn't seem right at the moment, I believe his int is in the 120ish range
Dash : the effect is more noticeable at the ends of the spectrum
Sensei : I know I was pretty surprised to be getting the same number of pracs
Dash : the formula we use has a slight curve
Dash : but over the long run you will notice your deikhan getting a greater number of pracs
Sensei : it must be really slight for a 50-point difference to not have a value... :\
Dash : this is your 4th level deikhan?
Crane : i agree with Sensei, i have 119/119 int/wisdom
Crane : and i usually get 6.5 pracs on average
Dash : i really don't think thats enough data, since there is probability involved
Dash : well the range is such that maxed int will give about 9 pracs a level
Crane : maybe i drop these values for focus or something else for monks
Dash : average is about 6.67 or so
Crane : the scale just seems to be "too large in the middle"
Crane : sorry no solutions here....
Dash : you mean too small?
Dunlen : hey
Dunlen : i gotta say, KVM SWITCHES ROCK!
Dunlen : anyway
Dunlen : um
Dunlen : me and frob
Dunlen : are the only ones
Dunlen : pretty much
Dunlen : who have passed basic
Dunlen : now... i got 6 pracs last level
Dunlen : my int is 150
Dunlen : last version that would have been 8 pracs
Dunlen : 7-9
Dunlen : er
Dunlen : 7-8
Dunlen : you say his average was 6.67
Dunlen : with 119 int
Dunlen : and before you said mine was 6.84
Dunlen : so for 30 more int
Dash : no, i said average int
Dunlen : i get .2 more ?
Dash : 119 is not average
Dunlen : what's average
Dash : ok you're taking two different functions
Dunlen : i have the highest possible human int
Dash : average for basic training pracs is 6.67
Dunlen : and still get gimped
Dash : your advanced training average is 6.84
Frobozz : last version, with 180+ int I would get 8 pracs till 25, where I would finish asic training and constantyly get 9 thereafter.
Dash : your basic average was greater than 6.67. i don't know what it was off the top of my head
Dash : sorry to all i just booted
Dash : blach
Dash : ok
Dash : here is the goal with practices
Dash : we determine a final learning we want for each intelligence
Dash : using mages as an example
Dash : we want a maxed out mage (which is slightly better than theoretically possible) to learn slightly less than 66% of his advanced disciplines
Dash : in this case, that would be between 4-4.5 out of 7 maxed
Dunlen : what was it last version
Dunlen : for a maxed mage
Dash : it was fubared
Dash : i have no clue what it was
Dunlen : says who
Sensei : meaning...
Straxx : shouldn't pracs be based on a classes prime stat?
Vryce : So a new curve was initiated?
Dash : meaning the formula was whacked and unpredictable
Dunlen : lemme just state this
Sensei : apparently
Dunlen : across the board
Dash : no, otherwise intelligence has very little effect
Dunlen : more skills = more fun
Dunlen : more skills = more fun
Dunlen : does everyone agree
Apollyon : more skills can overpower people htough
Ciani : not necessarily
Birch : I have a q - what is the scale?  what is the "maxxed int" that you referred to earlier, Dash?
Kinil : then pick a gnome char dunlen
Dunlen : yeah
Peel : its always a balance between more fun and more challenge
Elohssa : i do
Apollyon : thats why multiclasses were overpowered
Dash : um i'd rather not say what min maxes are
Straxx : maybe do pracs off a classes prime stat..and int can give a boost on pracs?
Peel : if we just gave everyone all skills., then it wouldn't be fun
Kelson : I agree that more skills = more fun.
Birch : and as to more skills, more fun - varied characters, more fun?
Dunlen : so all my chars have to be gnomes to have a lot of skills?
Sensei : the only problem I have with this is that there seems to be no reason to play a higher int char atm
Dash : just because it takes away from the game
Dunlen : oh right
Elohssa : thats not the point
Dunlen : cuz when my cleric has those extra pracs to put into restore limb
Dash : dunlen, think about how many skills are in 4 mage disciplines
Crane : it seems like you only derive benefit/penalty if your int is 190 or 40 on pracs
Dash : MAXED mages disciplines
Dunlen : i'm gonna be cursing the mud for giving him those extra pracs
Crane : from my limited understanding of how it is set...
Dash : crane thats not correct
Araxus : I think if everybody got all skills, everybody would be the same and it would be no fun whatsoever
Ciani : chars should chose it's focus. no one is good at everything. it's not realistic
Crane : maybe i exaggerate some
Dunlen : lemme say this
Dunlen : last version
Dash : that was the goal, ciani
Peel : piece of shit mud
Dunlen : so
Dunlen : last version we had too many skills?
Vryce : I just don't want to be a clone
Frobozz : Im a mage, I have had a bunch of mages
Sensei : what I don't like is the fact that a 30-point deviation in int doesn't seem to have much effect
Dunlen : yeah
Kelson : organizer show list
Frobozz : I know what spells etc Im aiming for.
Dunlen : i have 40 more int
Dunlen : than enisp
Dash : sensei, that should not be the case, but i'll look into it, and if it is, i'll fix it
Dunlen : and i get less pracs
Dash : so its kinda pointless to continue bringin it up :)
Sensei : I'm wondering if this isn't across the board tho, something fundamentally broken
Dunlen : go on frobozz i wanna hear what u have to say
Sensei : lots O' people seem to have had probs with it
Frobozz : I know what im hoping to get this char.
Sensei : thaz all :}
Dash : it could be a rounding error, conversion from double to int
Frobozz : would like to know if I will have the practices or not.
Dunlen : exactly
Straxx : ok..onto next subject
Dunlen : last version
Dunlen : you could plan out a character
Dunlen : now you can't
Dunlen : another new 'challenge'?
Dash : you just need to relearn the system
Sensei : welll
Dash : you didn't plan out dyehead
Sensei : in a way, we're still sort of in beta
Dunlen : yeah i did
Vryce : that takes more time than some of us have though
Frobozz : in air I would like to max flight. thats all I would want in air. not sure what % or how many pracs that is
Dash : uh huh
Dunlen : i knew how many pracs he was getting after level 30
Sensei : soo decisions will be changing as things evolve
Frobozz : In sorcery, I would like to max it.
Dash : and you know how many pracs you're gettig now
Dash : there's only one change in the curve
Dunlen : i don't
Frobozz : in earth, max meteor swarm
Dunlen : i was told i should be getting 7/level now
Dunlen : because i have max int
Dunlen : i got 6 last level
Straxx : hey...i have 196 int..gimmie 9 pracs is all i'm askin'..2:)
Frobozz : in alchemy, max divination
Dash : who said that? i didn't
Dunlen : you said i should get 6.9 pracs/level
Frobozz : in spirit maybe get fumble.
Dunlen : is that closer to 6 or 7
Dash : straxx 196 should be normally 9 pracs
Dunlen : plus the fact that in our discussions, i was gimped 26 pracs, and got reimbursed 9
Straxx : only seen 9 pracs 2 times
Dash : i said 6.84
Sensei : before or after L30?
Dunlen : ok
Dunlen : so
Dash : you've leveled once since then
Elohssa : isnt this just kinda bickering?
Birch : umm... yeah
Dunlen : is 6.84 closer to 6 or 7
Dash : probablility dude
Dunlen : is this that 'new math' thing?
Dash : ok take algebra or something man
Dash : learn what probability is
Dunlen : got an a
Straxx : so..probability..you said i should get 9..yet i'm at 20% getting 9 pracs so far..kinda low probability
Dash : then come back and bring this up
Kelson : TIme out.  I've never rec'd 9 pracs, and my int is 200.
Dash : it could be the curve is too great straxx
Dash : as i said to sensei, i'll look at it
Dunlen : i got 5 pracs from 29-36
Dunlen : got reimbursed 9
Peel : my int is 250 in real life and I get 9 pracs every level
Kelson : lol
Dash : ok this is getting silly
Dash : dunlen, you're getting off topic
Dunlen : no
Dunlen : i'm not
Dunlen : so
Dash : yes, censorship
Dash : sorry
Dash : i'm talking about the current setup
Dash : not what you got for your X levels and what you got reimbursed
Dash : we're not talking about YOU we're talking about the mud
Jesus : damn lucky to get anything
Dunlen : so
Dunlen : when i get 6 pracs next level
Dunlen : who do i bend over
Dash : dunlen, leave
Straxx : so..if ya find a problem with the prac  curve then what..any reimbursements?
Dash : or stop being an asshole
Dunlen : i'm serious man
Dash : roll three dice
Birch : 1.  I think it was reasonable and kind to reimburse Dunlen and others
Dunlen : 150 int
Birch : 2.  Dash said he'd look into irregularities, can we move along?
Kelson : I think what he's saying is that if it's not working for him (Dunlen), it's not working for everybody else.
Dunlen : 6 pracs
Dash : if you don't get greater than 50% at least once, is the world broken?
Dunlen : that's wrong
Dash : no
Dash : live with it
Dash : such is probability
Dunlen : whatever i'll bitch another time
Dunlen : move along
Straxx : yea..move along..here..here
Sensei : nothing to see here
Elohssa : im happy to get 6 to 7 ptracs per lev
Dash : what do you want me to do? round up? that would defeat the point of having fractions
Straxx : yea..i'm happy to just mud and see peel..2:P
Sensei : enough on pracs folks?
Vryce : This isnt' the topic you're looking for
Dash : ok, pracs are done
Sensei : or is there more to truly be said?
Birch : well, maybe not see Peel...
Dash : next topic, multiclasses/hybrid classes
Dunlen : organizer, add me
Dunlen : organizer, add me
Dash : ok
Dash : a word on this topic
Peel : I'm gonna go watch a movie now
Peel : so in closing I'd like to say, you are all homosexuals
Dash : basically, i will not condone the reinstantment of multiclasses unless they fit into the current game balance well
Dash : however, its jesus's project mostly
Jesus : its my project totally
Dash : yeah that too
Dunlen : well
Dunlen : as a purveyor of multiclassial pride and power
Dunlen : i think they were a lot of fun
Dunlen : powerful yes
Dunlen : overpowered at times
Dunlen : yes
Dunlen : but way fun
Dunlen : it was a reason to hit 50
Jesus : id like to point out a few things with multiclasses before discussion starts
Dunlen : ok
Dunlen : go ahead
Dunlen : i'll start after u talk
Jesus : just a few things to keep in mind
Jesus : multiclasses were removed because when they were initially put in
Jesus : they were not balanced as thier own entity
Dunlen : yes true
Jesus : they were more or less slapped in and you had the beneefits of 2-3 classes
Dunlen : they were like 2 chars at once
Dunlen : i think hybrid would be cool
Jesus : makeing them 100% desirable to players
Jesus : of course
Jesus : BUT
Dash : <c>Dunlen says, <1>"i'll start after u talk"
Birch : that is from before
Frobozz : I myseld hated multiclasses
Jesus : in order to have proper multiclasses they should have been coded as a seperate class
Jesus : thier own skill
Jesus : prac scales etyc
Jesus : that way it is fair to singleclasses
Jesus : which the mud was written for/with
Jesus : that being said
Jesus : multiclasses are gone
Jesus : in order to code a balanced class
Frobozz : and I hope thy never return
Jesus : you need about 6 months avg of work/code time
Jesus : to do the job properly
Dash : oops
Jesus : 6 months X 7-8 multiclasses = 4 years?
Sensei : I personally think the multis were pretty nifty
Jesus : dont look forward to multis comming back soon
Jesus : also
Jesus : i am in the process of bringing shaman into the mud
Sensei : simply for the fact that you could have a thief that could pop around the mud, and help heal people and such... you had a real fighting cleric
Jesus : i am about 1/3 - 1/2 done
Sensei : the mage/thief was a tad overpowered I think :}
Jesus : i'll shutup
Sensei : I was annoyed at W/C's cleric-bashing
Sensei : that was plain silly
Jesus : since im not being listened to anyhoo
Sensei : I'm listening
Sensei : but, I only have 120 seconds too :}
Sensei : 1/3 to 1/2 done...
Jesus : ok :)
Elohssa : ok, if multis are gone, so be it.
Jesus : about 3 more months i should open shaman to open play testing
Jesus : right now i have one play tester beside myself
Jesus : this class will be a VERY advanced class
Jesus : if you think mages are hard to play
Jesus : this class will NOT be for you
Elohssa : ive heard it said we are trying to get away from a twink mud image, yet now all we have are twink mud classes
Jesus : yeah
Jesus : we should get rid of thieves
Elohssa : hybrids add spice, a different element & are just plain fun
Romnat : laf
Romnat : sorry, im late
Romnat : was the rate at which mobs were healed covered?
Dash : we're on multiclasses
Romnat : Mobs heal way too fast
Romnat : Can I change it up?
Dash : topic boye :)
Dash : no let everyone have a turn on this one first
Romnat : cool
Romnat : multilclasses it is
Romnat : they are gone?
Romnat : and that's that?
Jesus : more or less
Romnat : then i have nothing to say
Romnat : next
Araxus : I'd just like to point out, that back in the olden days
Araxus : multiclass was nice, but it wasn't the absolute shit
Araxus : single classes could always do individual skills better
Araxus : in a world of 50/50/50's
Araxus : belmont, my single (and only in the game) thief
Araxus : had a x10 backstab
Araxus : while the 50/50/50's had at most x5
Araxus : and somewhere along the way skill like that was lost when everything was blended into generic skill
Araxus : I think multis could still be cool if their access to advanced discipliens was limited
Araxus : and invdividual skills were more powerful in the hands of a single
Dash : if we want to keep the balance constants we have now
Dash : multis are very hard, because you have to account for weird skill combos
Araxus : also, multis were offered from day 1
Araxus : you didn't need a 50 to qualify
Dash : thats one of the major problems facing multis
Jesus : much more fair araxus
Vryce : My comment is, that right now there is no reward for hitting 50
Vryce : when I started I WANTED those dual classes
Vryce : so I put in the time to hit 50
Vryce : now...
Vryce : Give us a reason please.
Dash : the multis at 50 thing is new as of 4.5 or so
Dash : there was no reason before that
Dash : didn't seem to be a problem then
Dash : any ideas on that?
Sensei : I have one thought:
Birch : why should there be a reward?
Jesus : the old multis were actually difficult playing
Apollyon : Do we really need reward?
Straxx : What is to happen post 50..then to maintain the person on this mud?
Sensei : let us keep the utility skills
Sensei : like astral and port
Vryce : Are shaman going to be limited to post 50 chars?
Araxus : well, in a world of 50/50/50's, I had the most fun backstabbing the biggest npcs in the game to death in 1 blow
Sensei : and levitate and (maybe haste) and featherfall and sorc globe
Araxus : and I wouldn't trade that for all the sanct and astral walk in the world
Jesus : more or less
Jesus : 50 is the end of the game
Romnat : New class options for level 50's may be a good idea (Shamans since they are so "advanced" may fit nicely into "
Birch : Organizer, show list
Romnat : that
Vryce : End fo the game?  Surly it can't be...
Dunlen : ok
Dunlen : i think 
Jesus : most all games have an end
Dunlen : multi's were overpowered
Dunlen : yes
Dunlen : but not all of them
Vryce : no no no...it's not true...
Araxus : well, what would you do when you hit 50/50/50?
Dunlen : ever see a 50 w/t?
Dunlen : who
Sensei : or W/C
Araxus : before, we used to hang around for quests to improve our chars
Straxx : ok..multi's are out.w.e know that...so..what is to keep a player at 50th level still interested in playing here?
Dunlen : who had a 50 w/t
Dash : wintermute
Araxus : since the in-game means of improvement was over
Dash : before your time
Dash : a few others
Dunlen : ah
Dunlen : well
Dash : winter was my buddy though so i remember him first
Elohssa : 
Dunlen : in the year i played i never saw one
Crane : Organizer, show list
Dash : point?
Sensei : dey ain't no list, foo
Dunlen : all i saw were c/t's
Dunlen : or m/t's
Elohssa : organizer, add me
Sensei : and M/T's
Frobozz : heh multis blew, can we change the subject? heh
Dash : and mw and mwt and clw
Araxus : what will happen is everybody will hit 50, try a couple other classes to 50, all the artifacts will get eaten up
Dash : etc etc
Dunlen : yeah but m/w/t's sucked
Dash : point?
Sensei : clw sucked hardcore
Araxus : and they'll purge the players again in the next version
Sensei : cuz of cleric-bash
Elohssa : do we have open debate now?
Dash : debate is open
Dunlen : afk sec
Elohssa : one thing icve seen on another mud i play is whats called anavatar class
Sensei : yo
Elohssa : avatar
Frobozz : avatars are basically paladins essentially
Dash : heh dunlen went afk withoput telling us his point
Maarken : most of those muds are unbalanced elohssa
Jesus : he usually does dash
Frobozz : "to do good etc"
Frobozz : its coz he has no real point.
Dash : yea basically
Dash : ok anyway
Elohssa : its a reward for pcs who have reached max in normal classes. they have to quest to become avatars, but get special skills if the succeed
Straxx : ok..next topic..holy water..2:)
Birch : okay, Dunlen bashing is a waste of time
Glint : YOU ALL NEED GLASSES
Dash : that being said i'm gonna move us to the next topic
Araxus : in older version, once you hit 50, you spent most of your time aquiring quest gear with custom names
Araxus : kept everybody entertained for years
Dash : and add 'rewards to 50' for the end if anywone wants to stay
Jesus : sorry
Dash : ok
Dash : next topic is exp caps
Frobozz : ok I have no full idea how the cap works, where it hits in, and if it increases per level.
Dash : its kinda complex
Jesus : give a brief dash
Frobozz : but as a mage, I do no damage for a few rounds, then hit one big hit.
Dash : i don't want to give details cause there are ways to get around it
Dash : but basically it gives you a minimum kills per level, and enforces it
Dash : most people NEVER hit it
Frobozz : if anyone hits the cap I see it as being either mages or thieves.
Dash : frobozz its smarter than that :)
Dash : its not per hit
Frobozz : its not ?
Dash : ie high damage skills wont hit caps more than low damage skills
Frobozz : what If I go kill 100 mice, and then attack a really high mob ?
Dash : its a pretty flexible cap like that, very predicatble and nice
Dash : smarter than that too
Jesus : it was going to be a hard line cap
Jesus : no more than X at Y level etc
Dash : basically the cap doesn't do much but point out inconsictancies to us
Frobozz : do we get told if we hit the cap ?
Dash : usually people don't hit it
Jesus : its dynamic now
Frobozz : or could we.
Dash : but it will DEFIANTELy keep people form powerleveling each other
Dash : no you don't get told
Frobozz : I often wonder if im wasting components on a mob thats capping out on me. 
Dash : thats why we didn't say anything about the cap
Dash : don't worry about the cap guys, its pretty invisible
Dash : frobozz is speaker
Frobozz : I was in a group a while ago.
Frobozz : and I dont know if the cleric on the group knew what he was talking about
Frobozz : but he was sure we werent getting full exp for killing gnome ant riders.
Frobozz : thats why I mainly wanted to bring it up. 
Dash : im curious how he would know
Frobozz : he remembered average exp from mobs
Dash : but it could be a combination of trophy, or cap
Dash : from when? last version?
Frobozz : was sure we were getting less overall.
Dash : means nothing
Frobozz : so exp in mobs has changed per version ?
Frobozz : or trophy would factor in ?
Dash : not that i know of
Straxx : ok..i'm only level 11..but i don't see any probelm with exp
Dash : anyway version to version doesn't mean much comparitavely
Straxx : if it takes me a few more kills..so be it
Jesus : i do see one problem with exp
Straxx : it is the thrill of the hunt..i don't stat hunt exp
Dash : dunlen has yet to realize that
Jesus : maybe not directly exp
Jesus : but a problem
Straxx : enjoy the game folks..and lets move on to more pressing issues..2:)
Romnat : Im curious that if you are in a group and one person has trophy to the point where they get little exp from a mob, does the rest of the group suffer?
Jesus : no rom
Romnat : ok
Romnat : Also, this exp cap
Jesus : trophy is kept individually in a SQL database
Romnat : If we dont know when we get capped how do you guys monitor it?
Jesus : logs
Dash : we have our testing logs set up
Dash : maarken you here?
Maarken : if the exp cap is for you (imms) to notice problems withe xp, why cap it for the mortals
Maarken : yes i am here
Dash : the exp cap is in place to stop powereleveling
Maarken : why should the players have to be capped when it can be logged
Dash : primarily
Maarken : and is it really the place of imms to say your leveling too fast? (or too slowly)?
Dash : basically dunlen cudgels a grumpy midget for his low olevel friends
Dash : it keeps them from elveling instantly
Dash : so there's no point
Dash : its a hard coded saftey valve
Maarken : flag the mob to be "owned" by dunlen and everybody else gets 0 exp
Dash : its pretty lenient in normal gameplay
Dash : maarken it almost never touches normal gameplay
Dash : if it does, thats when we know that we have an inconsistancy
Maarken : it's a rather round about way to solve a problem that could be solved by a simpler solution
Dunlen : bull shiatt
Dunlen : ok
Dunlen : so check this out
Dash : thats not a simpler solution
Dunlen : frobozz will agree
Dunlen : balls of skin
Dash : we have too many cases to catch
Dunlen : worth 400k xp each
Dunlen : i soloed them at level 29
Dunlen : i got 150k
Dunlen : each
Dunlen : that's a big ass cap there
Dash : they're level 41
Dunlen : so what
Jesus : its not an ass cap
Dunlen : if i can kill the fuckin shit
Dash : this is one of those times when it is pointing out an inconsistancy
Dunlen : lemme get my xp
Dunlen : i can walk into amber castle
Dunlen : right now
Dunlen : and kill most all mobs
Dunlen : with 2 clerics
Dunlen : i should get my xp
Dunlen : if you want to put a cap on to prevent plevel
Dunlen : put it on levels 1-30
Dunlen : or 1-25
Dunlen : but once you get to the 30's
Dash : say dunlen, i've never seen you hit caps in amber since we put our changes through
Dunlen : in the right group
Dunlen : you can kill most anything
Dunlen : hey dash
Birch : all I want to say, is that if something is unbalanced, then you don't "deserve" the xp
Birch : it's not "yours"
Romnat : Oh
Romnat : Good idea on throwing that cap on low levels
Romnat : Since plevelling doest matter after 25
Romnat : I think you should consider it
Sensei : I'd like to say that if I can get a crit-kill on something, I should get the xp
Dash : you do
Sensei : or something of that nature
Dash : its not a by-hit cap
Sensei : so if my L10 char crits an elite, he gets full xp for it?
Sensei : THERE I would say is 'earning' it
Sensei : and quite the badge hehe
Dash : sort of
Dash : if your level 2 runs up and crit kills the fisherma
Dash : just by kuck
Dash : luck
Sensei : then I laugh like hell
Dash : did he really 'learn' anything from that/
Sensei : and want my 2 levels :}
Dash : in my opinion no
Sensei : err, level and 99%
Jesus : thats a cap sensi isnt it?
Vryce : I have to address the issue of groups with clerics, they allow you to take things MUCH higher than you normally would, how is that taken into consideration?
Jesus : i have a bit of a gripe about that myself
Vryce : especially if there are multiple clerics
Jesus : we dont want to force grouping nor force soloing
Vryce : theoretically with one healing and one penning, you could take about anything
Jesus : my experience playing this version is that groups are "more rewarded"
Jesus : but not true
Jesus : or not 100% true
Vryce : well there does come a point
Vryce : but still would we be hitting a cap?
Dunlen : to finish my prev. point
Jesus : individually
Dunlen : at my level
Dunlen : i can kill amber castle with a couple level 20 clerics
Jesus : this cap as trophy is an individual factor
Dunlen : i should be able to get the xp that i deserve
Dunlen : for killing that kind of mob
Dunlen : now, meanwhile i'm hitting this cap
Dunlen : i'm also getting these mobs added to trophy
Jesus : and of course its "faster" because your moving healing etc alot quicker
Dunlen : so i hit the cap and at the same time i get less and less xp per hit
Dunlen : so i'm getting dp'ed here
Dunlen : it's like.. pick one or the other
Dunlen : trophy or xp cap
Dunlen : at level 30 it should stop
Dunlen : cuz together i get screwed even more
Dunlen : i never got the amount of xp from a ball of skin that i should have
Dash : how bout, you barely touch the cap anyway, and kill a different zone for once
Dunlen : never once got 400k
Dunlen : and never will
Dunlen : because
Dunlen : trophy kicked in
Dunlen : and now i get less xp for killing them
Jesus : you kill on an avg 7-10 levels higher than yourself
Dunlen : so what
Dunlen : that's good
Jesus : that a fair statement?
Dunlen : that means i know how to play
Dunlen : i should be rewarded not punished
Jesus : yeah you should kill corsairs more often
Romnat : Organizer, add me
Elohssa : that means you have clerics
Frobozz : means you know how to use a low level cleric for your own means
Dunlen : um
Dunlen : i just killed ryakk the bat
Dunlen : what level is he
Elohssa : the low lev cleric dont get much at all
Dunlen : u think i got full xp?
Dunlen : oh i did?
Romnat : I agree with the statement that getting punished for killing something higher level than you is stupid.
Dunlen : i got 250k
Dunlen : he's worth more than that
Jesus : it is romnat
Dash : however, i don't see how that statement applies
Jesus : has anyone taken the time to analyze thier own play?
Elohssa : so how can this be addressed?
Dunlen : i get capped on a regular basis
Dash : of course
Romnat : Well if he can kill balls of skin (400k) and is only getting 150k due to whatever
Dunlen : that's not right
Jesus : has anyone taken the time to analyze thier own play?
Dunlen : yep
Romnat : and they are 10levels higher...
Dunlen : i kick ass
Dash : romnat at the current set up he cannot kill balls of skin at level 29
Jesus : considered the affects of a trophy system?
Dash : i've made some changes since then
Dunlen : i get capped when i kill nivek ogre
Maarken : it's difficult to consider the affects of systems that you don't have full knowledge on how it works, jesus
Romnat : I think trophy is a great theory but has bugs.
Dash : and basically, he's just not killing the most efficient mobs for his level
Dash : it comes down to that
Dash : he knows how to play 5.1
Elohssa : id like to make a quick point. this is another example of balancing according to power players, not average, or let alone new pcs
Dunlen : efficient smificcient
Dash : he doesn't know hwo to play 5.2
Jesus : trophy is quite straightforward
Dash : exactly, thats why he's getting capped
Frobozz : nivek is in a noheal zone, killing him with your flee med etc is cheesy 
Jesus : the motre you kill the same stuff the less you get
Dunlen : i don't do that
Dash : he sits outside and shoots arrows
Romnat : Thanks for the idea.
Dash : same difference
Jesus : sin
Jesus : damn afk a sec
Sensei : cept he prolly tracks now
Frobozz : what the hell are monks doing with the ability to shoot ? 
Romnat : Are we on the topic of trophy now?
Dash : moving to topic of trophy
Jesus : sorry
Frobozz : ok I like trophy
Frobozz : it forces people to explore etc.
Jesus : as you kill the same stuff more and more it becomes easier? know what to expect etc?
Frobozz : I have no idea how fast/slow it goes back to the norm.
Frobozz : what I wanted to know is does a death kick it back a notch ?
Jesus : dont think so
Jesus : trophy is a career thing
Frobozz : so its permanent ?
Frobozz : as in I max out a goblin and goblins maxed out for good ?
Dash : correct
Frobozz : what about the unlucky who die alot though?
Romnat : I have the same concern as Frob
Dash : all the exp is never completely gone, and there are plenty of zones
Romnat : With the death exp formulas and trophy
Dash : i believe trophy stops at 50%
Romnat : Those who die are getting penalized.
Dash : yeah, its called penalty for death
Romnat : Along with all the other death penalitiees
Dash : correct
Romnat : Just what we need, another
Dash : but it doesnt come into effect unless you die alot at the same level
Romnat : I will say that idea of forcing people to kill in more areas is an excellent idea.
Romnat : Even so
Romnat : Something to consider.
Romnat : Thats not balance.
Dunlen : i wanna know where i'm gonna kill at level 49
Dunlen : and 48
Dash : wherever you like
Dunlen : cuz i'll be able to kill the same shit after level 45
Dunlen : so those levels, which used to be super long
Dunlen : are gonna be even super longer
Dash : so, youre screwing yourself by killing the wrong stuff now
Dunlen : plus, exp cap fucks up trophy
Dunlen : no
Dash : so plan ahead
Dunlen : that shouldn't be the case
Dunlen : i shouldn't have to think to myself
Dash : yeah sorry
Dunlen : hrm i'd better not go for that level now
Dash : don't want to make you think
Dunlen : cuz then
Dunlen : it'll take me longer later
Dunlen : that's bullshit
Dash : why?
Dunlen : i should be able to level however fast i want
Dunlen : if i want to go to amber castle and kill now, i should either get full xp
Dunlen : or have it added to triphy
Dunlen : trophy
Dunlen : not both
Dash : i disagree
Dash : i dont think you're going to run out of exp
Vryce : I would like to know if simply hitting a mob adds it to trophy or does killing it add it
Dash : if you kill a mob halfway, you get half a trophy count on your list
Vryce : and how do clerics obtain trophy, or do they?
Dash : it splits between group
Vryce : oh
Dash : so clerics gain it with their group
Vryce : ok
Sensei : I think trophy is flawed, and sa I've said before...
Sensei : I think incentive-based systems work better
Sensei : than hammering people that go to the same zone because they know it well
Sensei : AND know they can keep their party alive in it
Sensei : without worrying every damn step
Sensei : there's a reason people go to certain zones to kill, get money, etc
Dash : yeah because its easier
Sensei : if you want 'em to move zones, put incentives in the zones you want 'em in
Sensei : no
Dash : and easier = < difficulty
Sensei : because you LIVE longer!!!
Dash : and < difficulty = < exp
Sensei : that;'s my point
Frobozz : okies I always thought that trophy went and took up exp up to about 80%
Frobozz : 50% is sweet. so you kill twice the amount to get same exp
Frobozz : what really irritates me is when i see someone who has hit 50 and yet doesnt know how to go virtually anywhere
Frobozz : thats just totally wrong.
Frobozz : also when i get 3 elementals
Frobozz : and I group them, and order them to attack a mob.
Frobozz : if I dont assist at all
Frobozz : I dont get the mob put on my trophy list.
Romnat : Well, Dash's point about planning ahead makes me think if some issues.  If you know that there will be a exp cap due to trophy and you have to plan for the future
Romnat : That is going to affect group play, I won't group with just anyone if I have to watch what I kill and where I kill
Romnat : Also, do you guys realize that there are only 12 areas that are level 40+ and only areas above level 46
Romnat : only 4 areas above level 46
Romnat : Did you take into consideration that there just arent enought high level areas to support people going 50
Dash : there are
Jesus : and about 300 different mobs above 46
Romnat : with the trophy 
Dash : we did the math
Jesus : -50 i would never touch
Jesus : maybe 50
Romnat : People are encouraged to group with the trophy sysytem
Romnat : er arent 
Romnat : And it seems this version to be more towards groupiong
Dash : how does trophy hurt grouping?
Romnat : Organizer, show list
Vryce : question
Romnat : Because
Ciani : What I'd like to know is if a character is remade, does it keep the old trophy?
Romnat : If I have to keep tabs on what and where I kill
Dash : at the moment it does, we're fixing that though
Vryce : that's the one
Vryce : ok
Romnat : and plan for the future
Romnat : I wont go with groups in certain areas that I know will be added to trophy
Elohssa : it doesnt hurt. but it brings up the old adage of not everyone may want to group all the time. yet as things now are, grouping is almost a necessity
Sensei : the thing I'm afaraid of is that it's gonna hose casual players
Romnat : And if ther group wants to go there and they need a mage...tough shit
Sensei : why? think of a 40
Romnat : and that affects grouping
Sensei : 40+ casual player
Sensei : they kill in a zone for awhile, then they have to go elsewhere
Elohssa : nothing wrong with that
Sensei : but, doing that incurs them (and their group) mor hardship and annoyance and danger
Vlad : The penalties for multiple deaths in the same level are extremely severe...especially for low levels
Frobozz : well if Dash is right about the 50% cap, that just means it will take twice as long on the same mob, thats not that big a deal, not really
Sensei : increasing their chances of death
Sensei : that's true frob, if it is truly 50%
Romnat : I agree Frob
Sensei : which is kinda funky, but it'd be livable
Frobozz : I just want Dunlen to actually explore some more. 
Romnat : The game really hasnt been made more difficult, its just more menial/repetitive to get where you want to be (In terms of levels)
Sensei : I'm just thinking if they have to go to another zone where their chances of death are 70%...
Sensei : I totally agree with romnat
Sensei : oh yeah
Dash : so they be careful
Dash : they put together a good group
Dash : it wont matter
Dunlen : i kill where i like to kill, i'm not going to go cleric killing
Sensei : IF one's available
Frobozz : we all know that without the cap/trophy Bass would prob be 50 now.
Sensei : ok
Dunlen : ever
Sensei : get this
Sensei : good group?
Sensei : if I have to go to LH to get exp cuz I've trophied everywhere else...
Sensei : it ain't gonna matter what kinda group I have
Dunlen : we're gonna die
Romnat : laf
Sensei : which is really gonna hose your casual player
Dunlen : i don't do clerics
Dunlen : period
Romnat : good point Sensei
Frobozz : well if its a case of going to lionheart, or killing 2 elites instead of one...
Sensei : most people don't
Dunlen : not with the burn code as it is
Dunlen : if burn code was lessened
Sensei : but if you don't play all the time
Dunlen : i'd kill clerics
Frobozz : I hate burn code. bye bye comps.
Sensei : what's the sense in playing if it takes twice as bloody long?
Dunlen : but when i go to a level 13 zone
Sensei : I mean, it already takes forever to get thru 40's
Dunlen : and a level 13 cleric flames all my level 50 gear
Sidartha : the point in playing is that it's supposed to be hard
Dunlen : that's pretty shitty
Dash : i don't think these problems will arise in trophy
Sensei : twice forever?
Romnat : And thats all it does, takes twice as long
Sensei : that's not hard
Dash : unless a person dies alot
Sensei : that's tedious
Sensei : romnat made a good point
Sidartha : it's not supposed to be a game you make 50 in with 2 rl days of play time
Dash : if they do, we will reevaluate the situation
Jesus : so level 13 fire doesnt burn as well as level 50?
Sensei : the mud has not gotten harder with trophy
Dash : but as of yet i'm not convinced that its a huge problem
Sensei : it's gotten much more tedious
Dunlen : no, level 13 shouldn't be able to cast on level 50
Frobozz : heh yeah what was yr record sid? 3 days
Dunlen : like harm
Elohssa : no one has ever done that sid
Sensei : twice as tedious in fact
Dunlen : or curse
Jesus : when your 50
Dunlen : should be level based
Sidartha : my personal record is way less than 3 days
Jesus : i should come pk you with a 13
Sidartha : but i played 20 hours a day
Dash : next topic
Sidartha : non-stop
Jesus : and of course that would be fucked up
Dash : mob difficulty
Sidartha : you all suck my cock :)
Dash : ie healing rates, flee rates, aggro, whatever
Romnat : Ok
Romnat : I think mob healing rates are ridiculous
Romnat : If you dont kill a mob in one shot
Romnat : its unkillable since it heals so flippin fast
Romnat : Also, its almost impossible to kill mobs that flee
Dash : if anyone hasn't notice
Dash : i've cut the healing rates in half since then
Romnat : Also
Romnat : Mob aggro is crazy
Romnat : Because I cant even go into zones to get comps
Romnat : Without dying due to super-aggro
Romnat : Comps for spells that I got 3 levels ago
Romnat : Id suggest moving those mobs
Dunlen : ok well
Dunlen : simply put
Dash : basically, be careful
Dash : if you want to make a run to drow, get a group
Dunlen : i kill a mob  easily
Dunlen : that mob kills mob b easily
Dunlen : yet i can't kill mob b easily
Dunlen : tat's fucked
Dunlen : #2
Dash : no its not dunlen, thats life
Dash : difficulties vs weaknesses
Dash : rock paper scissors,
Dunlen : dudebro
Dash : whatever
Dash : it doesn't work that way
Dunlen : monk on warropr
Dunlen : monk on warrior
Dunlen : monk on monk
Dunlen : monk on warrior
Dunlen : is same shit
Dunlen : plus mobs still heal too fast
Dunlen : thief mobs heal faster than i do
Dunlen : with toginsa
Dunlen : yoginsa
Dunlen : and yoginsa is too slow
Dunlen : i hav eit maxed
Sensei : welll
Sensei : I actually gotta agree with dun on one thing
Sensei : mobs do seem to get too many hits
Sensei : they hit like monks
Dash : you mean their hitrate is too high?
Sensei : is every mob a monk mob?
Dash : or too many attacks
Sensei : no, they get too many swings
Sensei : but
Sensei : what I actually came to talk about was the draft
Sensei : sorry, alice's restaurant reference...
Dash : thats pretty arbitrary, just fyi the damage they do takes # of attack into account
Sensei : anyway
Dash : so its nothig more than a flavor thing
Sensei : you said you put in code since my post to change healing dash?
Sensei : cuz I haven't played since then
Dash : yeah i played with my values a bit since then, they are quite a bit lower
Sensei : but before that, in 2-3 ticks a mob that was at bad went to excellent-perfect
Sensei : it was a tad much :}
Dash : low level mobs did
Sensei : but, I'll shut up till I see it
Sensei : :}
Dash : in theory, players the same level did also
Sensei : I want to say oine thing
Dash : that was the problem, they player side wasn't as predicted
Frobozz : ok I always thought yoga for monks was for between fights, so monks dont have to sleep etc like warriors, thats just me I guess
Frobozz : fleeing mobs I have a really issue with. I have seen a mob attempt to flee 3 times in one round, there was 3 ppl attacking at the time.
Frobozz : to me that seemed a little bogus.
Dash : yea i'll check that out
Dash : if its new its prolly an unwanted side effect
Elohssa : i think mob heraling is about right
Dash : it seems to be at a good value right now
Elohssa : ive tried it on mobs of from fair fight to i hope you have a good plan, fled, heald & come back & they seem to heal about like how they should now, not co
Elohssa : er not counting fleeing
Elohssa : i agree with dunlen that yoginsa should be bumped up a little too slow
Jesus : should a player heal faster than a mob?
Elohssa : organizer done
Jesus : why?
Vryce : the only thing I really wanted to say is that a non-warrior type, should be able to take a mob 1-2 levels above it, as a lowbie
Vryce : and still be able to flee and come back at it, and eventually wear it down.
Dash : originally i thought it should be exactly equal, but that is pretty harsh if a player has to flee
Vryce : That's my standard.
Dash : i want to get it to a point where they can kill it if they need to but it takes long enough to make that tactic inefficient
Romnat : Dash your comment about "be careful getting comps"  or "go get comps with a group" is ridiculous
Romnat : Who the fuck am I going to get to go with me just so I can get comps in the Myrian or Drow, where they may also die?  No one."
Dash : drow isn't that difficult
Dash : if you dont try and run past everything and just kill the stuff
Romnat : Doesnt matter how diff you think it is/isnt
Jesus : heh
Romnat : The point is that mages shouldnt have to get groups to go get low level comps
Romnat : That is unbalanced.
Jesus : you have spells that should aid you in comp gathering
Jesus : true?
Dash : why not? out of curiosity
Romnat : There are many mobs in drow and myrian that can see invis/sense life
Dunlen : hey
Dash : in my opinion
Dunlen : Time to die, Someone!'
Dash : aggro should be aggro
Dunlen : that's bullshit
Dunlen : number 2
Dash : ok so bug it dunle
Dunlen : mobs doing 25 damage a hit
Dunlen : to 35 damage a hit
Dunlen : is lame
Dunlen : no matter how high level they are
Dunlen : the arch vampire would then do 50+ damage a hit?
Dunlen : with hps gimped as they are
Dunlen : how is someone supposed to play without a cleric
Dash : monk hps
Dash : monks aren't supposed to be the tanks they were before
Dash : god forbid you have to use a warrior
Dunlen : i have 100 less hps than enisp
Dunlen : at the same level
Dash : yeah, i'll give you one guess why
Dash : different version
Dunlen : ah
Dash : different game
Frobozz : what level is ryak the bat ?
Dash : roughly 45-50
Frobozz : btw, there are 2 mobs in drow that see invis, succubis, and drow mages, easy to avoid.
Frobozz : if you can kill a level 45-50 mob at your level dunlen I dont see why you should have a reason to complain.
Frobozz : the ocean, isnt easy now, but there are lots of exits.
Frobozz : as long as you can see well, you can normally dodge most aggy sense life mobs
Frobozz : also sometimes elf warriors are on the beach.
Sensei : uhhhh
Sensei : is this thing on? on... on... on...
Dash : c'mon you're filling up valuable hard drive space
Sensei : forogt I was in list :}
Sensei : ah well
Kelson : I agree with Romnat that a spellcaster who has to go into "aggro territory" is a bit too much.  I'm at the point where I have to go through bear territory to practice theology.  I've died too many times trying to go through that area.  
Kelson : How is that balanced?  In the last version, I could go to Gobs w/o problems, now it's inaccessable to me.
Dash : ok i'll look into they difficulty for getting to the problem areas
Kelson : organizer done
Dash : but keep in mind, i see nothing wrong with people having to group and be cautious going to trainers/gm/sellers
Romnat : I think that if mages are going to get groups to get comps, make them do it for comps like dragon bone
Romnat : If I want greyhound paws not only do I have to head to the misch-imp to get invis-ink and then I have to get a group together and goto drow and find the comp trader, Drow priestesses also can either see invis/sense life, if they hit you you go vis, thesay
Dash : i think thats a good thing
Romnat : once you are vis the rest aggro
Romnat : make it so for high level mage comps
Dash : off the top of my head
Romnat : dragon bone the best out there
Dash : i would make some air elementals
Romnat : just loads and you can find it i the shop
Dash : hit autoengange all so i don't do any damage
Romnat : ive done all that 
Dash : have the elementals hit him, then leave him fighting
Romnat : until the next room
Dash : you can occupy the mobs in the way, not go vis
Dash : you can do it
Romnat : where the next room there is a guy who can see invis/sense life then they attack
Romnat : forget it
Dash : so you do the same thing there
Frobozz : priestess's in drow have never seen me invis, ever.
Frobozz : what I fear is the 2nd alchemy and sorcery trainers in the circle...
Dash : ok
Dash : last topic
Sensei : umm
Sensei : test
Dash : after this
Sensei : k
Dash : is rewards for 50th level
Sensei : the main problem I see with mob aggro
Sensei : 2 of 'em actually
Dash : if anyone is interested in discussing that
Sensei : one: what if there are several mobs in the same room
Sensei : like robbers
Sensei : *ouch*
Sensei : and two, deikhans kinda get the shaft going to BM :}
Sensei : going to trainers and such is gonna require groups now
Sensei : no doubt
Sensei : and if everyone else is busy...
Sensei : my .02
Sensei : actually one more
Sensei : you have to have the right group members on
Sensei : who are WILLING to group
Romnat : Also the incredible skill of robbers being able to backstab with no skill attempt lag whatsoever, isnt reasonable and priestesses sensed my ass a few time
Romnat : drow priest, back to frobs comment
Dash : yeah romnat i saw your 3 dozen bugs
Dash : its on the list of things to look at
Romnat : And?
Romnat : That goes for alot of mobs
Dash : its a general problem, not something specific
Dash : argh sec forgot syntax
Sensei : w00t
Romnat : Mobs should have the same lag time for skills as we do
Vryce : what other ideas are there for hybrid chars?
Frobozz : whats the shaft with going to BM ?
Sensei : errr
Dash : romnat dude
Dash : complain about it some more
Dunlen : cyclopses
Vryce : Cyclopses
Sensei : it'd be nice if mobs would run outta mana/piety
Frobozz : heh
Frobozz : thats what the carrage thingy is for
Dash : you're like the people who push the button continuously waiting for the elevator
Dash : IT DOESN'T GO ANY FASTER :)
Sensei : hey
Romnat : just making a point sorry you are impatient about it
Sensei : I do that
Jesus : fear the 18th floor
Vryce : note to self, design elevator that goes faster with repeated button presses.
Sensei : well? code faster!
Jesus : note to self
Sensei : had to =)
Dash : ok ok
Dash : rewards to 50
Dash : for 50
Jesus : never react the way that was just displayed
Dash : do we need them?
Vryce : any additional ideas for hybrids?
Dash : oh hybrids
Dash : i have stuff drawn up for azruzi and bards
Frobozz : egotrip scares me now.
Sensei : azruzi?!?
Dash : i'll never get around to it prolly though hhee
Vryce : azruzi?
Vryce : bummer
Jesus : well
Dash : yeah they're really neat too
Sensei : y'know how long I been waiting for that class?
Sensei : since 3.1!!!
Dash : maybe this summer
Jesus : we more or less have 3 hybrids now
Sensei : wanna remake DW :}
Sensei : hmm
Jesus : shaman will be a 4th
Vryce : dieks monks and shams?
Ciani : mind explaining the class azruzi
Frobozz : whats an azamajig
Sensei : raise hand: I see no hand here.
Dash : deiks monks rangers
Vryce : ah
Frobozz : oh I thought it was a water elemental.
Dash : in my vision azurzi are holy assasins
Sensei : azruzi=antipaladin, ne?
Jesus : holy assassins?>
Dash : i designed them after playing oni so they have quite a bit of ninja to them
Sensei : azruzi=C/T?
Jesus : oxymoron
Dash : kinda c/t kinda m/t
Dash : not really either
Sensei : ooooooo
Sensei : gimme somea dat
Dash : they're clerit thief in the way ranger is mage/warrior
Vryce : now THAT would be a goalf or 50
Dash : they're neat, i hope i get a chance to get around to it
Vryce : what about zones that are opened up for L50 chars?
Sensei : that's called LH
Sensei : and the pyramid
Sensei : hey how many of the 300 40+'s are cleric mobs?
Sensei : 50%?
Vryce : good question
Jesus : *sniff*
Sensei : it's valid...
Sensei : hmm
Jesus : are rewards really necc. for a 50?
Vryce : what about a prize for anyone that can hit 100% mobs killed?
Vryce : well more of as a goal to shoot for
Kelson : Not necessary, but nice.
Sensei : now that would work
Vryce : that's what made me play so fevorishly
Jesus : there is one reward that noone has taken any advantage of
Sensei : or prizes for like 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100%
Jesus : not one
Vryce : not that I really WANTED to play a dual class, I just wanted the ability to
Vryce : what's that Jesus?
Jesus : to be immortalized in the world
Sensei : does anyone KNOW about it
Sensei : nope.
Jesus : be made into a mob
Vryce : I've thought about that one actually
Kelson : What is it?
Jesus : placed in the world etc
Vryce : get L50 in each class
Sensei : hmm
Sensei : interesting
Kelson : ah
Dash : or a statue
Jesus : retire the character
Sensei : there's already a Sensei
Dash : but i think everyone would rather be a mob
Vryce : does that all have to be done with the same name? or just in the same account?
Frobozz : heh not many imms wanted people putting players in the world.
Jesus : like
Kelson : If it's a kick ass mob that doesn't kick your char's ass later.  :)
Jesus : the only one i know of that was going to do it was tyson
Jesus : he was going to have his little island in the ocean
Sensei : narrelus had it done
Jesus : in a hut
Jesus : etc
Frobozz : I was going to do it with SpinelesS
Jesus : no
Sensei : err, smyrke did it for him
Jesus : gnarrelus
Jesus : that was a cheapie
Jesus : like ironpaw
Jesus : etc
Frobozz : I wanted him to be in dark dwarves, as an aggy mob. berserker dark dwarf.
Sensei : it was pretty cool tho :}
Sensei : actually he always called himself gnarrelus
Sensei : so it fit
Frobozz : there is a peal and travis in the world...
Dash : dunlen must be afk, its too quiet
Dash : anyway
Sensei : lol
Jesus : no
Araxus : so I have no idea where you guys are
Jesus : hes buffin
Araxus : factions do squat?
Jesus : his helmet
Vryce : rewards for L50's
Dash : atm factions do very little
Jesus : heh
Araxus : bring the metaphysician back on a non-linear scale
Frobozz : factions suck
Dash : cept give anvil an excuse to kill you
Sensei : thank god
Jesus : anvil seems to be into it
Sensei : factions can stay doing nothing
Jesus : so does dunlen
Sensei : vangard can eat my shorts
Dash : ok anyway
Vryce : is he around still?
Jesus : vanny is annoying
Araxus : nobody remember the metaphysician?
Sensei : factions were his idea, and he can keep 'em
Jesus : no
Sensei : specially forced factions
Dash : anything else anyone particularily wants to discuss? cause otherwise i'm gonna go get dinner
Jesus : think kriebly was in on the idea
Sensei : the forced part was his idea
Araxus : you could spend 1M xp to gain +1hp
Sensei : I KNOW it was
Araxus : 5M xp to gain +1 stat
Araxus : so 50's could keep building
Sensei : woo
Vryce : interesting
Frobozz : I used to be a snake, but I always thought the snakes shoulda been totally neutral but logrus started attacking snakes.
Araxus : however some people didn't like the unlimited range you had with it
Dash : that might be cool
Araxus : so I suggest a scaling cost
Araxus : 5M xp for first +1 stat
Araxus : than 6M xp
Araxus : etc
Vryce : ok, eyes are not focusing to well
Araxus : it gives 50's a reason to keep getting xp
Dash : ok i'm going to close the formal meeting now
Vryce : thanks all
Dash : unless anyone has any objections
Sensei : neh
Dash : thank you all for coming and being patient :)
Sensei : thanks for listening dude :}
