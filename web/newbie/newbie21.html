SneezyMUD is presently experimenting with a new rent scheme.  Please read
HELP <A HREF="../help/rent">RENT</A> for the latest information.
<P>
Our present goals with regards to the rent system:
<OL>
<LI>A balanced economy such that rent cost is not necessary for draining money
from The World.<P>
<LI>A rent charge in-line with a realistic examination of what services an
inn provides.<P>
<LI>A system which does not penalize a player for NOT playing.<P>
<LI>A system that does not need hands-on management in the event of unforeseen
down times.
</OL>
