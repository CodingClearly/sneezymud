<P>Not much is known about Satan anymore since he has rarely been seen around Sneezy as of late. The only picture
of him in the SneezyWeb Team's possession is also quite out of date (something to the order of 6+ years old), and
apparently there is no updated picture forthcoming. Due to the lack of sufficient visual excitement, the above
link contains some humorous content along the lines of what Satan would find hilarious (<B>DISCLAIMER:</B> SneezyMUD
is in no way associated with AfroSquad). What <B><I>IS</I></B> known about Satan is that he has been around since
v2.5, and has perpetuated a cycle of having a strong presence for months at a time on the MUD and then fading into
obscurity. Rumored to have constructed a healthy chunk of the world, he has earned the moniker 'The Maker' (rumors
also have it that his contributions are <I>greatly</I> exagerated *bahahaha*). Notoriously lazy and obnoxious,
somehow he has managed to maintain an Immortal on SneezyMUD - who knows, perhaps he will regain his motivation
and charge onto the scene again (current status: funktified).</P>
