<P>Learning comes from two places.  You obtain a skill
set using practices and you get actual learning by using your skills.  This
includes combat and other automatic skills like dodge.  A character's maximum learnedness in a skill is defined by how many practices they have used on that skill (or rather, on the discipline that contains the skill). A character's current learnedness depends on how often he or she actually uses the skill.  Please
understand that we do not consider learning rates structural.  If a learning rate seems to slow or
fast that is a balance issue and is now easy to fix.  We want to hear about all balance issues
without reservation.  Structural issues we want to hear about but we also know that you can not
please everyone.  Our structures will only be modified if they are clearly not correct.  We are
aware of the tradeoffs that we have made for 5.0 (see section on <A HREF="quick6.html">balance versus diversity</A>) and
believe we have gained more than we have lost in this area.</P>

<P>Disciplines are organized
into basic disciplines and advanced disciplines.  All prerequisites were moved into your basic
disciplines which consist of 2-3 disciplines for each class.  One holds the basic skills of the
class. The other holds basic combat or casting skills.  You now learn
adventuring and get your wizardry/faith level directly from your guildmaster although you can also
use (i.e., waste) practices on them if you wish to get a skill early.  Tactics and evaluate are part of the adventuring discipline now and combat is reserved for combat skills.  Basic disciplines take approximately 60 practices to reach their maximums. Specialization disciplines take far fewer. Again see separate section and help files for full explanations.</P>
