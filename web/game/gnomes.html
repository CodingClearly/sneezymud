      <h1 align="right">Gnomish Territorial Backgrounds</h1>
      <p>As you will learn, your character's characteristics are largely governed
      by your racial selection. Territorial selection serves as a modifier on
      these natural stats. So in essence, you are choosing a sub-race here that
      will slightly offset the characteristics of your racial norm.</p>
      <p>Territorial choice does NOT grant any additional skills within the
      game. However, some skills may be impacted directly or indirectly by your
      choice of background. The chief effect of territorial choice is to modify
      your natural racial stats. </p>
      <hr>
      <p><b>Urban</b>: A city dweller. You were born to a family that had left
      the traditional tribal lifestyle behind, and moved to an urban center.
      Your family was most likely involved in trade, or politics, and encouraged
      you to take advantage of the contact with other races, and the other
      benefits of civilization. You have become disassociated from the
      traditions of gnomish life, but have replaced them with the accouterments
      of city-life. gnome details not yet written&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Villager</b>: You were born in a typical gnome village, and had an
      unremarkable childhood. Gnomish communities tend to be highly communal,
      and you had high contact with educational and medical facilities. You grew
      up surrounded by your fellow commune members, and were well informed of
      the gnome traditions.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Hill</b> <b>Gnome</b>: As a hill gnome, your commune was somewhat
      smaller and more remote than was typical for a gnome community.
      Nevertheless, you learned the ways and lore of your people, and even benefited
      from the isolation by learning to deal with adversity. </p>
      <p><b>Swamp</b> <b>Gnome</b>: By gnomish standards, your commune was
      excessively small numbering only a few hundred gnomes. It was located in a
      very inhospitable part of The World, and each member of your commune was
      forced to give their utmost to insure the survival of the whole. This
      sometimes forced you to adopt and use techniques that differed from those
      of traditional gnomish society. </p>
      <hr>
      <p>Most gnome tribes are civilized, although a small number have shunned
      contact with the Civilized Races, and are thus regarded as wild tribes.
      Wild tribes often differ in characteristics from those of their civilized
      brethren due to long-time genetic inbreeding (and in some cases,
      cross-breeding with other wild races). Wild gnome tribes vary in
      disposition and characteristic, some are merely xenophobic, while others
      have allied with dark forces and are fundamentally opposed to the
      existence of all of civilization. Some wild tribes are such just because
      of political due to their location. </p>
      <p>The Svirfneblin tribes are the most notable amongst the wild tribes.
      Little is known about this reclusive society, and contact with them is
      often dangerous. </p>
      <p>Players are not permitted to play members of the wild races due to the
      fact that they would be unwelcome within the bounds of civilization.
