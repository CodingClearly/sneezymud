		<p>Note that, with some exceptions, any race can try to be any class,
		but many combinations will not make good characters. Your race
		gives you a range of stats and you can only modify compared to
		a generic member of your race. Magic stat bonuses are no longer
		limited by racial maxes.</p>
		<p>Hybrid classes such as deikhan and ranger have a number of overall
		improvements that improve their playability but also are more
		limited as casters now. Clerics as a whole were slightly downgraded
		by losing the pet skills (to be returned in the shaman class which
		will appear some time after the MUD goes into production), there
		have been some changes to fighting/engaged casting and mages were
		increased in power. Monks and thieves were restructured. Thieves
		have new trap skills and monks are going through a pretty thorough
		change in focus which may continue into 5.0.</p>
