Day 1
It seems I may have finally escaped that crazy bitch.
It almost makes me cry to think how pathetic it is that
she can’t even take the time to understand h own
daughter. I’m better off far away from thestinking
Shire and it’s nasty fruit. Elric’s taught mentye pl
enough to survive in the world. Good bye banal village
life!

Day 2
Blew up some cyclopses, left one with syphilis. Been
a good day. Not quite sure where I’m going t o,but I
haven’t heard the old woman for more than a full day
The silence is deafening.

Day 3
Passed the big city whence the murderous swine that
pillage our village come. Left some indelible marks 
on the city gatekeeper and moved on.

Day 8
Met up with the swamp water lady Elric told me about.
He musta been plenty drunk when he formed his impressions
of her. Nice enough, though, and she’s kept me welled f
for days. She taught me a trick with some soap that
should come in handy…. I might just stay here. Th
frogmen are kinda cute. 

Day 10
That crazy bitch! I had to leave the swamp! Momma’s o
looking for me. I had to make a run for it while the 
swamp water lady distracted her.

Day 17
Hiding out with some lizard folks. Showed them the soap
trick. They seemed surprised.

Day 25
Met up with a lonely looking ogre in the jungle. He
seemed to need a guiding hand, and I have been getting
pretty lonely. Hope I’m not lunch.

Day 30
Well, the ogre’s helped me make a little hut in a ee.
Seems I’ve got me a new home. It’s nicebe up above
those damn bugs!

No idea what day it is…
My home is great. Ogre is still around, and he’s keepi
me … good company. Never mind.I just need to vent in
writing – my janky Momma’s in the swamp! I’d kill 
she wasn’family. I hid the entrance. Maybe she’ll gi
up. As long as the still keeps working, I’ll surviv
Damn, why won’t she JUST GIVE UP!
