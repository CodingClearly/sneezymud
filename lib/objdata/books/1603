General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF GROWTH

But the rift had profound results on both sides.  The Faeries were of one
people and their powers were entwined with both each other and The World.
Stripping the powers from the First Tribe had weakened the Faerie folk - and
worse, had weakened the powers inherent in The World.  With both lessened in
strength, the Faeries realized difficulties of their own.  Their powers were
not as great, nor as far reaching, and slowly they realized that exile was not
a viable option.

Meanwhile, the First Tribe was achieving stunning advancements.  Having decided
to forsake their magikal heritage, they concentrated on their natural forms.
With the remains of their power, they explored a previously uncharted and
forbidden realm by taking on the forms of the flora and fauna they found there.
What magik was left to them flourished, although no longer could they perform
with merely a thought.  In time, The First Tribe became the Tribes, and as the
powers grew further and the shapes they chose more permanent, the Tribes became
known as the Elves.  Sixteen bands of Elves dotted The World claiming ownership
of the lands, seas and sky when The Elders presented themselves to their
prodigal brethren for the first time since the rift.
