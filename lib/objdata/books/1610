General Treatise from the Archive of Historian Anilstathis as it pertains to:
THE AGE OF DECLINE:

The Faerie power had been waning ever since the Elves departed.  The creation
of the Dwarves had weakened them further and the ill-fated Gnome project had
deeply depleted their reserves of magik.

Worse, The Elders now found themselves being second-guessed and doubted by the
other Faeries.  Factions began to spring up and the Elves were no longer the
only dissenting Faerie group.

The majority still remained true to the old ways, maintaining that the answer
was to force repatriation upon the Elven renegades and their kin.  But a
sizable minority advocated a full break and that the Faeries would be better
served by returning to the exploration of their magikal powers rather than
dwelling on the Elven problem.  There were whispered rumors that some Faeries
were leaning toward the Elven doctrine, and some even claimed that Faeries had
left to become Elves.

Thus it was, with powers diminished, magik depleted, and dissent rampant, the
Faeries entered the Second Great Age of The World.  With Faerie in a state of
confusion and decline, and focused on internal affairs, the dwarves, Elves and
gnomes were now free to develop without interference.
