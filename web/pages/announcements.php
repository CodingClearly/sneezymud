I decided to launch the new SneezyMUD Website with the arrival of our new server. Hope you enjoy the new look!
A number of the sections are still being worked on but should be coming online quickly in the next few weeks.
The old website is still available <a href="index.html">here</a>, should the need arise for something that cannot
be found here.  Comments and suggestions are welcome, email me at <a href="webmaster@sneezy.saw.net">webmaster@sneezy.saw.net</a>
or just catch me online! - Dash
