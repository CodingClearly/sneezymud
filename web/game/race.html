      World. There is some detailed information here on each of the races and
      their various territorial backgrounds. Hopefully you'll find what you are

      <p align="left">Mankind is the most prolific race on the face of The
      World. In fact, humans alone outnumber all of the other 5 civilized races
      combined. This has meant that civilization has grown along the lines
      dictated by mankind. Dwellings, roads, doors, clothing, utensils, etc are
      built with human specifications in mind.
      <p align="left">Human males range from 63 to 79 inches and 146 to 200
      pounds. Human females range from 61 to 72 inches and 104 to 140 lbs. As
      equipment is designed for humans, they rarely have trouble finding things
      that are a comfortable fit.
      <p align="left">Humans are gifted with the ability to be good in all
      classes. For this reason, they have average values for all stats, being
      neither extremely good nor bad at anything.
      <p align="left">Humans have no special abilities.
      <p align="left"><a href="human.html">Human territorial information.&nbsp;</a>
      <p align="center"><a name="elf"></a><font size="4"><a href="#human">Human</a>
      | <a href="#elf">Elf</a> | <a href="#dwarf">Dwarf</a> | <a href="#ogre">Ogre</a>
      | <a href="#hobbit">Hobbit</a> | <a href="#gnome">Gnome</a></font>
      <p align="left">Elves are perhaps the oldest race on the face of The
      World. They claim kinship with the lost Faerie race and there are no races
      with histories older than theirs to dispute this claim. Numerous sub-races
      of elves exist - everything from drow (dark elves), hill, forest or wood
      to the sea-elves that inhabit the deep. For the most part, when one speaks
      of &quot;elves&quot; in general, it is the fully civilized and
      city-dwelling elf that is meant. The elves that live in small enclaves
      often differ (sometimes remarkably) from their cousins living with the
      humans.
      <p align="left">Elven males range from 47 to 57 inches and 93 to 120
      pounds. Elven females range from 45 to 55 inches and 73 to 100 lbs. Elves
      are slightly shorter and much leaner than humans. The slight size
      differential means that they occasionally have trouble wearing
      human-designed clothing. However their build is such that they can usually
      make use of armor meant for the smaller races if that is the case.
      <p align="left">One of the elves' biggest gift is their intelligence which
      is due to their vast history. They are easily able to exceed the human
      maximum and even the dumbest elf can rival a humans. However, their wisdom
      is about the same as humans (they rely more on books then real life
      experiences). They do have more focus then humans though, being taught to
      concentrate on difficult tasks from small. But these gifts are offset by
      their physical frailty - strength, brawn, and constitutions rarely rise
      above average. Elves display both grace and beauty, their clumsiest member
      is just below the human norm and they also have equitable dexterity and
      speed to go along with this agility. Their amazing beauty lends them high
      charisma. Fate tends not to really play a role on elves. They sometimes
      are favored and sometimes have very difficult times. Also, elves tend to
      be slightly less perceptive then humans.
      <p align="left">It is said that elves faerie heritage has given them a
      strong resistance to the magical forces. It is true that elves are able to
      ignore the effects of paralysis and they have a strong resistance to
      charm. If nothing else this substantiates the claim to being distant
      faerie-folk. Additionally, their senses are supposed to be much more acute
      than ordinary humans or any other race for that matter. While they do not
      possess infravision per se, their eyesight allows them to see things at a
      much further distance than normal. Elven bodies are exceptionally
      streamlined and graceful. This gives them a vitality rivaled only by the
      massive ogres at the cost that health is recooperated somewhat slowly.
      Elves diminished size gives them inherent quietness and camouflage, which
      is increased even further in natural surroundings beyond the dwellings of
      civilization.
      <p align="left">Lastly, Elves most distinguishing feature is their pointed
      ears. However, it is considered ill-manners to make mention of this fact
      in elven society. Apparently, their misshapen ears are considered some
      sort of affliction and many first time tourists have gotten a fierce
      tongue-lashing for taking notice of this.
      <p align="left"><a href="elves.html">Elven territorial information.</a>
      <p align="center"><a name="dwarf"></a><font size="4"><a href="#human">Human</a>
      | <a href="#elf">Elf</a> | <a href="#dwarf">Dwarf</a> | <a href="#ogre">Ogre</a>
      | <a href="#hobbit">Hobbit</a> | <a href="#gnome">Gnome</a></font>
      <p align="left">Dwarves are the undisputed masters below a depth of six
      feet. They tend to be fiercely individualistic and proud to the point of
      arrogance. With most probability, dwarves are the eldest race in The World
      save for the elves who remind them of this fact whenever a dwarf starts
      spouting off about their rich traditions dating back millennium. Dwarven
      knowledge of metallurgy is unsurpassed.
      <p align="left">Dwarven males range from 41 to 49 inches and 199 to 235
      pounds. Dwarven females range from 39 to 47 in. and 164 to 200 lbs. Their
      diminutive size gives them a fair amount of problems in finding armor to
      fit. Interestingly, dwarves are regarded as the best armorers in the land
      yet they rarely make armor that will fit themselves as there &quot;just
      aren't enough dwarves to make it profitable.&quot;
      <p align="left">Dwarves are characterized by rugged individualism. Their
      physical constitution is unparalleled by any race. Likewise their strength
      and brawn rarely dips below the human norm. Dwarves, due to their hardy,
      brawny build, tend not to be as dexterous, agile, or as fast as humans.
      Dwarven culture prefers the physical arts over the mental ones, hence
      their intellect is rarely much higher than the human norm. However, since
      dwarves believe that things must be practiced in order to do it right,
      they have very high wisdom. They also show good concentration when they
      work. Maybe that is why the armor they make is so good. They don't go by
      any books, but spend many years of hard work and concentration to hone
      their skills. Being rather reclusive, they care very little for their
      looks, thus having below average charisma. They tend to be more perceptive
      then humans, needing it due to their lives in dark caves to go hand and
      hand with their infravision. Dwarves are also somewhat favored by fate,
      which has allowed to be around for such a long time and have a long
      history only rivaled by elves.&nbsp;
      <p align="left">Their strength of character gives them a strong tolerance
      to alcohol and has the added effect of making them immune to most toxins.
      Their life underground has cultivated their infravision capabilities.
      Being short of stature means they have smaller reserves of vitality, but
      their natural vigor lets them recuperate both vitality and health it at
      increased rates. Lack of magical prowess dampens their recuperation of
      mana however. However, it is this lack of magical prowess which lends some
      resistance to being charmed or from some energy spells.
      <p align="left">As dwarves small size but large mass makes them fairly
      dense, they have a natural aversion to water. Dwarves are incapable of
      swimming as they can't float and few dwarves will willing agree to travel
      by boat. They dislike large open areas unless it is a large cave and
      flying is something that would most likely cause a dwarf to pass out from
      fear.

      <p align="center"><a name="ogre"></a><font size="4"><a href="#human">Human</a>
      | <a href="#elf">Elf</a> | <a href="#dwarf">Dwarf</a> | <a href="#ogre">Ogre</a>
      | <a href="#hobbit">Hobbit</a> | <a href="#gnome">Gnome</a></font>
      <p align="left">Ogres have only been members of the civilized races for
      the last 200 years when StonesHead the Mighty settled his tribe and
      &quot;negotiated&quot; (&quot;You give food, me no kill&quot;) a peace
      with those he formerly raided. They have met with some resistance from the
      other races who do not completely trust them, but progress toward equality
      is being made. Not all ogres are to be considered civilized as roughly
      half of their population is still considered wild.&nbsp;
      <p align="left">Ogre males range from 85 to 95 inches and 292 to 424
      pounds. Ogre females range from 83 to 93 inches and 262 to 394 lbs. Ogres
      are typically larger than the average human. Rarely are they able to fit
      into human-sized armor. Being a wild race, most ogres tend to wear armor
      made from hides or skins. Due to their contact with civilization though,
      certain armors have been made to fit them.&nbsp;
      <p align="left">Ogres have superior strength, capable of going well beyond
      the human maximum while the weakest ogre is able to compete with the
      strongest human. They surpass even dwarves in strength and brawn. Having
      lived mostly in the outdoors, ogres are very hardy in constitution. Their
      large size though makes them rather clumsy and not very dexterous.
      However, constant fighting has allowed them to have higher slightly speed
      then might be expected by their large size. Karma usually frown upon them
      since they are rash in thought and usually put themselves in the face of
      danger, favoring fighting over negotiation or a more favorable way out.
      Intelligence, wisdom, focus, and perception are severely lacking due to
      their tendency to react rather then to think. Also, most races are
      repulsed by the habits of ogres, making charisma very low.
      <p align="left">Ogres toughness grants them resistances to the effects of
      nature. Fire, cold and poison have little if any effect, although in
      extreme cases an ogre has been known to succumb. Additionally, their size
      makes it simplicity itself to trek many leagues without tiring. The
      downside of their size is that it makes them rather noisy which is
      exasperated by their brash and surly manners.<p align="left"><a href="ogres.html">Ogre

      | <a href="#hobbit">Hobbit</a> | <a href="#gnome">Gnome</a></font><p align="left">Hobbits
      are the smallest of the civilized races although this fact does not seem
      to bother them. They are often called furfoots as their most striking
      feature other than their size is oversized and hairy feet which causes
      them to go shoe-less. They may be dwarf or gnome related judging by their
      size and their Shire's (hobbit communities) bare some resemblances to
      gnome warrens.&nbsp;<p align="left">Hobbit males range from 31 to 35
      inches and 57 to 72 pounds. Hobbit females range from 29 to 33 inches and
      53 to 68 lbs. At half the size of humans they always require armor made
      specially for smaller folks...and even then it sometimes needs to be
      scaled down.&nbsp;<p align="left">Hobbits chief advantage is their size.
      Small, unnoticeable and nimble they make excellent thieves with super-high
      dexterities, agility, and speed. For obvious reasons, they are very
      unbrawny and weak due to their size. They also have below average
      constitution. Hobbits, although not as lacking as ogres in the mental
      area, spend most of their time roaming The World and exploring. Thus, they
      have below average intelligence, wisdom, and focus. Hobbits actions are
      often considered comical, and even though ill-timed, they are still
      basically liked. Since they spend so much time exploring and tend to
      notice the little things in life, hobbits have an unparalleled perception.
      They also have great karma, since fate tends to shine on them when they
      leave their homes to explore The World.&nbsp;<p align="left">Hobbits have
      infravision and immunity to toxins which substantiates a dwarven heritage.
      Their short stature makes them naturally quiet and difficult to see. Their
      wanderlust allows them to range far from home.&nbsp;<p align="left">Hobbits
      have a unique culture that often clashes with civilized norms. They have
      no concept of &quot;theft&quot; and typically those who spend time with
      hobbits will find a good deal of their goods borrowed. Do not bother to
      confront them about it, they will happily return it and seem unable to
      understand what they have done wrong. Usually they just assume that if you
      need it, you'd just borrow it back from them.<p align="left"><a href="hobbits.html">Hobbit

      <p align="center"><a name="gnome"></a><font size="4"><a href="#human">Human</a>

      | <a href="#hobbit">Hobbit</a> | <a href="#gnome">Gnome</a></font><p align="left">Gnomes
      are probably related to dwarves as they are remarkably similar. In fact,
      the main differences are chiefly cultural. As a race, they have turned
      away from the individualism that characterizes their dwarven relatives and
      live in giant communes called warrens that house an entire tribe. They
      prefer hilly terrain for making their warrens and a typical tribe may
      number as many as one to two hundred gnomes.<p align="left">Gnome males
      range from 34 to 41 inches and 77 to 92 pounds. Gnome females range from
      31 to 38 inches and 73 to 88 lbs. Of diminutive stature, gnomes are rarely
      able to wear armor designed for humans and must resort to the smaller
      pieces of equipment that they can find or make for themselves.<p align="left">Communal
      living has allowed gnome lore to be kept and passed from the elders to the
      young in a manner that is unsurpassed in the civilized realms. Even the
      lowest Gnome's intellect and wisdom rivals the smartest humans. In fact,
      very few races, if any, can match a gnome's focus, intellect, or wisdom.
      However, such mental development comes with a very heavy price. Due to
      their severe lack of physical activity, they are extremely weak, not very
      brawny, lack any significant constitution, and extremely undextrous and
      clumsy. They also are rather slow in movement. Gnomes, however, are more
      perceptive and charismatic then humans. For various historical reasons,
      fate pays little heed to gnomes, despite gnome culture's close
      associations with the deities. As a result, their karma suffers.<p align="left">Like
      dwarves, their shortness of stature gives them lower reserves of vitality.
      Additionally, their bodies recuperate lost health more slowly. On the
      other hand, Gnome mental abilities and capabilities for regenerating lost
      mana is unsurpassed.<p align="left">Gnomes have maintained their
      infravision due to their underground lifestyle and have developed immunity
      to energy. This last is something of a mystery but it is something that
      gnomes are quite proud but refuse to speak of to outsiders.<p align="left"><a href="gnomes.html">Gnomish
